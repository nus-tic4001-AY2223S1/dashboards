I think it would be better to have

```
if (!csvFile.isFile()) {
    // handle error
    return null;
}

The `To` at the end of the method name feels unnecessary. Shall we use `changeAttributes`? Or `editAttributes` or `edit` which I think will match the user functionality more closely too.

This sounds like it's for setting today's date. But I think the intention here is to change the date that is to be filtered?

If we do `getDayOfWeek` means it will occur every week right? Should it be just `LocalDate.now()`? Btw if we want to get the string representation of a `LocalDate`, remember to use `DateUtils.formatDate` because `toString` doesn't return the same format as what we mention in our user guide. This could also be a reason why we get the error message `I don't know the date...`, because I realized this kept getting printed in the tests when we use `date.toString`.

Change to `"\\s\\w+\\/"` to fix #199.

Now it only detects one alphabet before the `/`. `\\s\\w+\\/` will make it detect any number of alphanumeric characters before the `/`, in case the user provides an invalid parameter like `abc/`.

@Kafcis I think we don't need to store the timetable generated from the task list in a file, because the same timetable can always be generated from the same task list. Looking at the scale of this, there won't be much impact in performance if we generate the timetable when the program starts. But if you wanna do it, you can use `getTimetable()` to get the week's timetable.

@alstontham The timetable given to the `Ui` will be a list of `TimetableDay` objects, each containing a date and a list of `Task`s. So you can work on printing that now.

Good catch. Currently if there are overlapping tasks, the second task will not show up in the timetable. I think we should leave this to the `TaskList` and `TimeAllocator` to ensure this doesn't happen? Because I don't think we should allow this to happen at all.

Btw for now, if the task duration exceeds the sleep time, it will be cut off at the sleep time. Perhaps we should push back the sleep time when this happens? We can open an issue for this if so.

We might need to postpone to v2.1 because our OOP is not really good enough to allow us to store this information anywhere, since our `Timetable` is instantiated on the spot when `list` is called. We would need a `Model` class that interfaces to all our backend stuff like `TaskList` and `Timetable` before implementing this.

Now we cannot do this because we are loading the `Task` attributes from the `TaskList` and filling them into the `EditCommand`. We can change `Task.edit` to instead check if the method arguments are `null`, and only modify the `Task` attributes if they are not `null`. By doing this, we can improve testability since `EditCommand` no longer needs to load the attributes from a `Task`.

Following `CircuitCommand`, what could be done instead is to put this in an overridden `toString()` method:

```suggestion
    }
    
    @Override
    public String toString() {
        return "The output of the current configuration is " + template.calculateOutput(0) + ".\n" + super.toString();
    }
```

Better yet, have a `private int output` variable in the class, and use `.execute()` to set it using `output = template.calculateOutput(0)`. Then you could replace it with `output` in `toString()`.

Needs revision - consider changing this to `BooleanTemplate` being associated with `Gate` objects, which all the other gates inherit from. Also, `TwoInputGate` only has `input` and `secondInput`, they do not know about other `Gate` objects. The logic is done from within `BooleanTemplate`.

Thanks for the feedback. Will fix, but will not appreciate the rudeness of this issue. Do provide feedback without sarcasm and more tact. @brandonywl

> The presence of a table to summarize keywords is great but other than code, the rest are only used 3 times or irrelevantly.

I disagree. Dr Jane (CS2101 prof) has informed us that this is a good way to make sure there is no confusion when different types of formatting or icons turn up in the guide. Maybe you can explain the rationale as to why they are irrelevant?

> Irrelevant use of bolding. Provides no significant information to user.

Would still disagree with this point though, since **CLIrcuit Assistant** is the name of the application. Maybe you can make your point with a proper explanation?

> For code, the bucket is too broad and confuses users as to what they should see and what they should type into the CLI. It is preferable to use screenshots instead for what they should see and that should reduce your issues by quite a fair bit.

Fair enough, I suppose there should be differentiation between only user input and formatting command words.

> Unclear which should I actually put into my CLI or should I see. Surprise! It's none of the two. Only the last line follows the standardized guide. This is repeated consistently across the UG.

It's unclear which two you are referring to here. The title/section headers are definitely not equivalent to the format, which admittedly could be explained more or with better formatting. As for the Tutorial commands, perhaps we could add a preface that the Tutorial commands should be followed to the T, and that the User Guide is only a general overview. Also, another preface to explain that all user input are under the Format: (maybe Format could be bolded or underlined) with the Expected Output being directly after could be placed before the commands.

> with no indication of when does it refer to expected CLI output, or what is an example input.

On this note, I was wondering whether you caught that "Format:" showed the actual input that was supposed to be used? Genuinely wondering, otherwise we might just put all actual input in the titles (currently all input are under "Format:") instead of explaining that they are under "Format:". As for the tutorial's expected output, it seemed like we shouldn't need to explain the in-tutorial output since that should all be self-explanatory within the CLI, but I suppose we could add an expected first output when using the command.

Is there a need to new the arrayList here? Ideally, ListNoteCommand should just call a function in notebook, say getNotes(bool isSorted, arrayList&gt;Tag>) (currently is only getNotes(), you can overload it).

This is also for reusability, having the function in the notebook instead in this ListNoteCommand Class. Do refer to the word doc I shared.

Suggested fix: remove the index-- after handling the PREFIX_INDEX because there is another check for the index value after the for loop. The check is needed in case the user did not enter "/i ...."  
return new EditNoteCommand(index - 1, note, addLists, editLists, deleteLists, isInput);

@prachi2023 The step to reproduce the bug is wrong, it should be changing the title manually in notebook.txt. Thus, when loading, it attempts to read an non-existent txt file and the content is empty. Maybe can do an error handling. When loading, if it is unable to find the note txt file, skip it. Also do a save all at the exit of Notus.

1. Set up and designed the architecture used for Event scheduling in the timetable.
    - Handled `Event`, `RecurringEvent`, `Timetable`, `Reminder` and other relevant `Command` subclasses for Event scheduling functionality.
    - Event functionality was designed with scalability in mind. Immutability was largely enforced to ensure consistency of Events even across re-occurrences. 
1. Implemented Single-Responsibility-Principle, Tell-Don't-Ask, and Liskov Substitution Principle in Designs.
    - Designed to reduce circular dependencies to reduce coupling.
1. Assisted in the development of two common `Parser` methods.

Suggestion below.
```suggestion
1. Implemented `TaggableObject` class which is inherited by `Note` and `Event`. 
    - Taggable objects can have multiple tags and different Taggable objects can share same tag(s). They can also be filtered by their tags.
1. Implemented `Tag` class which contains the name and of the tag and its color.
    - Added color support for user to better differentiate the tags.
1. Implemented `TagManager` class which manages all the tags in application. 
    - A hashmap is used where each unique tag are the keys and the arraylist of taggable objects that share the same tag are the mapped values.
1. Implemented the functionality to create tag, delete tag, as well as tag or untag taggable objects.
1. Implemented `ParserManager` class which manages the creation of different parser functions to parse the user input to the required parameters.
1. Implemented `SystemException` class which extends from `Exception` class.
    - Within it, there is an enumeration for all possible types of exception that may occur and each enum value contains a unique string as its message.
1. Implemented `Formatter` class which formats the different objects, such as Note, Event and String with a specified layout into a String to be printed.

Good effort with adding the implementation of timer feature. However, I think rather than constructing the `SingleTopicQuiz` object here you should be calling the `startQuiz()` method on an existing one instead. Also I noticed the `Question` object is not being used so it should be taken out. Furthermore I think if `QuizParser` is not an important part of the implementation of the timer it may also be excluded for brevity.

Yup it's supposed to be a solid line, thanks for pointing out! I just wanted to ask if this notation is ok for _object creation_ in sequence diagrams, because I can't seem to find a way to do it the way it's been [specified in the textbook](https://nus-cs2113-ay2021s1.github.io/website/book/modeling/modelingBehaviors/sequenceDiagramsBasic/) when I use PlantUML.

### General Structure of Video -&gt; UG

Intro -&gt; General -&gt; Circuit -&gt; Boolean -&gt; End

Ideally, these are the parts each of us could do:
* [x] Prepare intro part of the video @PraveenElango 
* [x] Summary and Bye Command Demo and Voiceover
* [x] Tutorial Command Demo and Voiceover @oasisbeatle 
* [x] Template Command Demo and Voiceover @dorianfong98 
* [x] Set Command Demo and Voiceover @PraveenElango 
* [x] Add Command Demo and Voiceover @hughjazzman 
* [x] Calc Command Demo and Voiceover @sevenseasofbri 
* [x] Any notable features at implementation level? or at documentation level? or feature level?

Preferably go through most permutations of possible commands and also include erroneous commands too. Try and keep the parts &gt; 3.5 mins long

I understand that you have incorporated question.markAsShown() function into the getDescription method of question now, however I feel that we should separate them out to enhance SoC and cohesiveness for the method. Will be doing that and hence for this part over here, the questions will have to be marked as shown separately.

@kstonekuan Yeah I believe we will have to add that in for v2.1 to let them understand the consequences, but in that sense our team have to explore if we should clear their stats score everytime they start a new quiz for that topic, as pointed out in issue #179

@kstonekuan I believe he added in the same question to test if the duplicate question will be shown. Our current algorithm doesn't catch this and I am not sure if we have to. This seems like a case we should point out to the user and ask them to not input the same question into the topics.json list of questions as it might not be meaningful to them as well. We can further discuss this.

5# (design and implementation headers) => bold text
6# (aspect of design)=> italicised text

For Neil's part on storage, I removed 1# from every header.

I realise now that if one were to enter `bye` into the prompt, it will cause `MESSAGE_GOODBYE` to be printed twice, once in the execution of the `ExitCommand` and once here. This is because Java cannot differentiate between a normal `System.exit` and CTRL-C.

Any suggestions on what to do? I was thinking of removing this shutdownhook and printing the bye in the NoSuchElement exception caught. Or removing the exitcommand and use this as an exit.

I moved it here because it was stated in this guide that the shutdown hook should be fast. So I decided to move it to `PromptType.Edit` commands.

Is it necessary to have such a test? 🤔 getCommand() just calls the nextLine() function of scanner class. So by writing this test, we are essentially testing the nextLine() function which has not been written by us.

Once you change the code according to the new classes handling bus data, you would still have a similar function that returns the bus route. I suggest you shift the printing to Ui class. See #26 for an example.

Since you have just one test, using createBusList() here is ok. If you have more than one tests for BusData, remember that calling it again might cause duplicate entries in the list.

Possible, I realised the name for this method may not have been the best, the idea was that I have a method that checks if both files exist - If they do, we will skip straight to file reading. If any of the files do not exist, we will proceed with save creation.

Perhaps you can consider splitting them into individual tests and the consider naming each test in the following three-part format: methodUnderTest_inputGiven_expectedOutput
E.g.
```
@Test
public void getCalorie_food_returnsCalorie() {
    assertEquals(480, testFood.getCalorie);
}

```
Also, for the assertEquals method, I think the parameters are (expected, actual) so you might also want to consider switching the variables around.

Sorry for informing you late, last night I decided to change the method name to ui.printPersonInfo(String personInformation)  to keep things consistent and shorten the method name, so perhaps you would like to make an edit as well.

I see. I was thinking that since all the exceptions are being caught here it could also possibly be catching an error from elsewhere in the system other than the command input.

Thank you for reviewing! 

- Reasons behind the implementation of setter methods: Possible future extensions that enable users to make edits to their information in case they have inputted it wrongly or if the information has changed over time. (Editing function is not currently available in this iteration as the user can restart the program to reinput the information but this function could be considered in the next when user data is saved and cannot be edited otherwise). However, if this is not implemented in the next iteration and is unnecessary, it will be removed. 

- Will add current weight field next iteration

As the Food class (functional but without JavaDoc comments) are already merged into the master branch of the team repo, maybe you can consider pulling the team repo into you local repo and merging the master branch to your branch (take note not to do it the other way around) so that your branch is up to date with the team repo and this would also likely minimise any possible merge conflicts.

Hmm Sam regarding point 1 and 3 yes effectively the project view replaces the list command which doesn't show anything useful.

If not lets say in my program i made a few changes such as adding deadlines to my tasks. In order to view the updated changes:
1) I have to return to home via home command
2) then select the project again via select just to view the changes

I propose just showing the project view when user types list command

Hmm in the user guide it's list though. If I rmb correctly its because users might be familiar with list from iP and it would be good if it shows the full list instead of a partial list if they execute the list command.

I was wondering if these fields should be part of `Item` or they should be part of `Task` because not all items we're adding might have these fields? For example if new classes like `Expenses` extends `Item` then it may not need all these fields, or let the fields be set.

Consider refactoring creating the command as a new method in CommandCreator class using the design patterns. You can pass in the full command or parsed command as an argument for the method. Check the add command and set command for an example. I didn't move everyone's commands because I didn't want to claim credit for the code.

There's so many constructors to ListCommand now, I wonder if we can actually pass in an enum to the ListCommand instead and use a switch statement in the execute method. But that will be for another time I guess (maybe v2.1 or another PR sometime later).

But then with enums we'd have to pass in blank arguments for "category" when listing category, so another point to consider.

Yes, the form of an argument is stated to be `&gt;key>/&gt;argument>`, thus `p/` is treated to be part of the description, as there is no `&gt;argument>`.

I think that since it is an error, you could consider naming it as such, and printing it in red.

The bug I am trying to solve over here is that, users can enter "list hello everybody" or "list p//" and it still works.
Since our list command does not require any params to execute, there is a need to check for any words behind "list".
inputWords is used in the function before calling getCommand() which checks if there are more than 1 word input.

I feel that we need to be clearer in both the implementation and the User Guide.
Currently, the "description" command takes in 2 params,  p/ and d/, if description is entered in project view, there is technically no need for user to type in p/ something since the projectIndex has accounted for the index number when you "select" the project. We are just inviting people to find this bug, because if you are already in a particular project view, we cannot change the description of other projects
Since "deadline" for a project can only be entered in homeview, i think "description" should do the same as well.

Will the user be entering a command to get tips? If not I don't think it should be a `Command` class... looking at the main class it seems like it's not, it shows up whenever the program first runs. I think can consider not extending `Command` and just use a standalone class, maybe something like `TipManager`?

Feels like this can be simplified, since the tips will be shown when the program first runs, and the user isn't going to be typing a command for tips. See the comment in the `TipCommand` class..

See the comments in the `Storage` class - I don't think its necessary to include a file path of the tips file since it's going to be included inside the JAR file, so can consider removing it from the constructor here..

So when you want to list the notebooks, the CliUserInterface can do something like: 

```java
CliCommand command;

if(input.startsWith("List"){
    command = new List(commandArgs, noteBookList);
} 
...
command.execute();
```
And then in the execute method:
```java
public void execute() {
    switch(commandArguments) {
    case "nsp":
        listNotebooks_nsp();
        break;

Because we add `...` which makes it 10. If we check for length greater than, say, 7, and then take the substring from 0 to 7, then if the title were something like `Buoyancy`, it would be turned into `Buoyanc...` which is actually more characters. I've seen this UI glitch before in actual, production software...

@longngng commented on this pull request.



In src/main/java/seedu/duke/userinterface/command/List.java:
>  public class List extends CliCommand {
+
     @Override
     public void execute() {
 

But the list() function needs the object as well, like listNotebooks_nsp(Notebook sampleNotebook), so I'm not sure how to code it. Also, should the List class handle input arguments like "nsp"? That doesn't seem follow the principle right?

Maybe it would be better to refer to them as objects  as opposed to their abstract meaning? For example instead of " `Note` objects in a `NoteList` from a specified `Topic`. " you can say "`Note` objects stored in a `NoteList` object that share the same `Topic` parameter."

Hi Sean @thatseant , let me answer the points:

> 1. There's no way to display project view other than selecting project.

Is there a need to display project view other than selecting the project? 

> 2. Multiple members are not shown.

Currently, each task can be assigned on member.

> 3. Tasks are not numbered so it is hard for user to see index of tasks.

Oh okay! I have built this from the mock-up that we approved and I did not include the index at that point. Maybe for the next iteration we can add an index column? For now, users can use the list command?

I used Object cause it was more type-safe. I was considering that when the timetable expands and has multi-year usage, we may have issues with recurring events and their reminders so I was implementing the equals function to be able to compare reminders. However, I revamped how the recurring events are displayed so this function actually has no more use.

I think it's fine because even in the lecture notes they talk about assert as a error handling as well as a JUnit. It can be used for both. I implemented it here as an assert because if its not the same then there would be big problems with the entire remind functionality.

While possible, I'd lose the information on the name of the month and at each event, I'll have to check the month and see if it's different at each step.

Sadly you did not face what I did which was 10-15 minutes of trying to use your User Guide on tutorial and it not working. It was phrased as a functionality bug initially before I looked at your code and found out it was a big issue in interpretation by the user using your UG.

1. I did say it's great, I just felt the consistency of usage was lacking. I found the three uses of information and warning to be good. I think the main issue I had with this was with reference to **bolded**. My understanding of keyword is that it is key to understand what that statement, command or relevant information meant. As a user I would already know what this app is and I don't view it as a keyword at all. There are much more important things to highlight. For example, in that exact same paragraph, bolding what type of simple circuits this programme solves goes a long way.

E.g.
CLIrcuit Assistant is a Desktop App to implement and solve simple **boolean** and **?circuit** circuits.

On the point of code. I understand when explaining your Interactive Tutorial, you meant to say tutorial type commands (tutorial circuit tutorial boolean). Like I said, it was a very large bucket where you used it to describe the first half of the command, with no indication of when does it refer to expected CLI output, or what is an example input.

Your usage of itallics on circuit tells me that it was something I should be looking out for, something technical. So when I saw the word technical in your format, I implied from your guide that I was to use that format but not that code. I implied what to be replaced with circuit was all the usage of code before this.

Can you remove this line? This is because _line 34_ has set `exit = true`. In `Duke.java` _line 63_, I have already added the check to check if the `exit = true`. Also, the `Duke.java` has to call `sm.save()` before it exits.

The code analysis stated this line don't need `StringBuilder` since you are only appending on string. you might wanna change that.
The newline should also use `%n` instead of `\n`. `%n` works similarly like the `System.lineSeparator()`.

This PR added a `shouldSave` boolean variable to all command classes. All command classes are required to define the `shouldSave` value and I have edited all the command classes to define it. Basically, those that cause changes to the data will set `shouldSave` to true. If you look at `Duke.java`, it checks the `shouldSave` value of the command class that has executed and invokes the save if `shouldSave` is true.
In your case, the project should have been successfully created and the save happens before the crash. That is why it shows the project that was created in the first place.

You are talking about the Unit Test assertions is it? Those assertions are different from the normal assertions. Normal assertions are placed in the code using the `assert` keyword, therefore the link I have provided only works for normal assertions. Anyway both have different purpose, so yeah.

From what I see in your branch's `Project.java`, it might be the case that `toJson` did not include `SprintRetrospectiveManager` data. Hence when the `save` happens, nothing is saved for `SprintRetrospectiveManager` and its sub-objects. So when you reload the program and try to access it, it is empty. You can verify this by inspecting `data/data.json` file to see whether the data for `SprintRetrospectiveManager` is inside.

You can refer to how I did it for `SprintManager`, `ProjectMembers` and `TaskManager`. They should be similar to your class.

I see, it makes sense.

In this case if the users type in `subject     ` (extra spaces) I think it will go to the condition `if (gotoSubject == null)` and show 'cannot find the subject'

if we change it to `if (message.length &gt; 2 || message[1].isEmpty())`, if will go in the condition and show NO_SUBJECT_EXCEPTION.

Do you think it would be better to show NO_SUBJECT_EXCEPTION or SUBJECT_NOT_FOUND_EXCEPTION in this case?

I think it would suffice to just change the error message from "Invalid index format entered" to "Invalid index format entered - please enter a number smaller than " + Integer.MAX_INT; or something along those lines so that the user know they are entering a number that is not within the range or a wrong format.

Currently when I tried
`/delete /i 2`
The description map will return
```
NAME -&gt; NULL
INDEX -&gt; 2

So without the null check, it will always try to get the cheatSheet by name even when the user tries to get it by its index

Hi, thank you for alerting me about this issue. I understand that it might be hard to find a suitable genre to search for as our current data size is limited to only 500 anime series (Given to us by AniChan) and that there are over 100+ genres available on the official site. 
Having a command to print all available Genres might be too cumbersome for the user and may defeat the purpose of a search. 

To rectify this issue, I have updated our User Guide to include the popular genres types that the user may be interested in finding. This genre could also help get the user started in searching for other genres as well. 

Do let me know if there is more I can do to improve it, thank you once again for the feedback!

This is an update from @AY2021S1-CS2113T-F12-2/developers we have met as a team and discussed this issue. The conclusion of the discussion was that adding horizontal lines will not improve the readability, but result in the output looking messier.

To better resolve this issue, the team have decided to improve the readability of the output elsewhere, such as the printing of the command execution result. This can be seen at #255 and will be further improved in future PRs. Thank you!

Hello @ShawnTanzc ,

I was unable to reproduce this error. Could you give me a screenshot of your files inside the `trippie_data` directory, as well as the contents of your `trippie.txt`?

Deleting the directory might fix the problem. Update me! Will fix the typo issue though, thanks for pointing that out.

`getFoods()` does not take into consideration the portion size provided by the user and it seems that you did not get and handle the portion sizes separately. Using `getPortionedFoods()` will return a food item with scaled nutrional values (different from the item the user entered)

The build tests are failing because of the dependency of the code on the Food class. Have you tested the code locally?

Possible workabouts:

I currently disagree with the proposed change in the above comment. I think that the Loader class itself should not be dependent on these other classes (Person, FoodList/Food, etc). This is to streamline dependencies. Current implementation of generic Loader looks good to me. I propose the use of class specific wrappers or child classes of Loader in future updates.

LGTM.

I thought of it also but I realized it's more of an improvement since as of now there isn't a need for it.
We have no feature planned that will use the enums, (e.g sort by priority).

What do you mean? For JUnit tests you don't need exceptions tho. You can hardcode the error messages.

Sorry the earlier comment wasn't very clear. What I meant was that since we have
```
ArrayList<FlashCard> getDeck() {
    return deck;
}
```
then would passing the reference to the ArrayList to shuffle cause the original deck to be randomized also?

If we want  to maintain the order in the original deck then perhaps a suggestion could be changing getDeck() in Deck class to
```
ArrayList<FlashCard> getDeck() {
    return new ArrayList<>(deck);
}
```
so that other methods cannot modify the ArrayList<FlashCards> inside the Deck object except through add and delete.

That is a valid point, perhaps a target CAP of 5 is not the best example here.

However, the problem is reproducible with the following input:
![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/48957360/97770892-63d42000-1b72-11eb-860c-206fa25893ac.png)

Suppose I set a target CAP of 4.499999992, the following output is produced:
![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/48957360/97771208-a9461c80-1b75-11eb-82e8-fdaf29ab7701.png)
This is different from what is expected because getting a 'B+' for 4MC and 'A-' for the remaining MCs would allow the target CAP of 4.499999992 to be achieved.

On a side note, I expected the program to round any CAP close enough to 5 to 5.0 from the following behavior:

Consider storing total monthly expenditure/income in a hashMap.

Increment/decrement the total amount whenever there is a change made. For instance, when a new expense of $25 is added to the ledger for June 15 2020, increment the total expenditure for June by $25. When this same expense is edited to become $45, increment June expenditure by $20. When this expense is deleted, decrement June expenditure by $45.

This way, there is no need to loop through all entries every time there is a new entry or every time you want to view the goal.

Avoid calling main() over and over again - this creates a new loop. So if the user does 10 operations, this will cause 10 nested main loops to be created. Should return to the top level main loop directly (i.e. use `return;`) and allow the main loop to continue

Changed existing interfaces into classes under 2 broad interfaces, making the code tidier. Looks great!

Though I agree with Joseph, more could be done to develop the interfaces to manipulate the lists in our program. Many of our lists have similar functions, hence we ought think of ways to better use interfaces here.

I think it'll be clearer if you put

```
assert cardIndex <= flashcardDeck.size() : "card index inserted should be less than size of deck at this step"
```
assert is used to check if the value of something is what it **should actually be**, in this case, you want to assert that card index is actually less than or equal to deck size.

Consider adding another check for cardIndex to be greater than 0 btw! Otherwise negative values might break the application.

I was thinking if it would be better to place quoteToPrint inside your toString() method and implement printAllQuotes() inside TextUi class instead? Then all you need is to call quoteList.toString() inside your printAllQuotes() method to print all quotes.

By right execute() should take in Storage as parameter and this line of code should be storage.save() instead due to the previous commit I pushed just now. Not sure why Git did not flag this as a merge conflict though.

Oh I see how your code works now. As a suggestion, it will be better to 0-index the number here, so that you will not need to -1 from other places of your code such as your delete() and findByIndex().

A suggestion is that this string can be set as a constant in the UI class and then you can call the constant (UI.constant name) here.  If the message is changed at the other class for whatever reason then this part will automatically change also so don't really need change manually every time.

Thanks for the feedback. It could be the case where the user has spent time on the module but has forgotten to update the app. So we shouldn't assume that the user did not spend any time on the module.

perhaps the logic can be further improved by checking for time validity first, and if it's valid, proceed to add event. In other words, the flow shouldn't be deleting the event only after realising the time is not valid. This results in duplicated code.

If the time is not valid to begin with, it should be thrown immediately and request the user to re-enter with valid timings. i.e. the case where "check for validity then add" does not need to happen, as the program will throw an exception

I believe that implementing a checkTimeValidity function with throwable in line 34 would have been suffice. The invalid times would not be added to the event when the program throws an exception.

Can you look into the following:
1. Your main loop do not have an exit condition. That's why you cant exit back to main menu
2. You are not using MenuPrinter in your feature. Hence MenuPrinter.prompt does not print error message for you.
3. May want to look into better presentation of error message
4. You may want to augment your command menu with what the user can input, I was not sure what to do

Please fix 1 and 2 then the PR will be merged. The rest LGTM.

The arrow coverges too much in the circled portion and thus it is making the class diagram more complicated than it should have been.  Maybe try to simplify the diagram by breaking it into portions or structure the arrows in a way that it is straight and pointing the class table more clearly.

Inconsistent arrow used (dotted and solid arrow) and the arrow head in the circled area is over the box which should have only been hit the box only.
Lack of system architecture diagram to show the overall design of the program. (only uml and sequence diagram is available).

For this diagram, it is hard to interpret if it is a uml class diagram as the boxes used are wrong and format of the diagram is not consistent with the format of a  standard uml class diagram.

The logic is the same, E.g. if you check  for validity then add and you still have to take into consideration of what happens if is invalid , keep or delete. So, if you check for invalid and remove them (not adding them) , it would be the same.

its even better to check and do action to invalidity first as after you check for validity you would still need to add and then keep track of the invalid (error message)

Just to explain the new changes for edit commands :

getRawEpisodesForSeasons() used instead of getEpisodesForSeasons() -&gt; this one checks array using season-1 so it'll lead to bounds errors

- If numSeason increases:
        - set a new array for episodes and init the new seasons with 1 episode

- if numSeasons decreases:
        - replace episodes with smaller sized array and delete the episodes in the later seasons
        - initially episodes=[10,12] for 2 seasons, when resized to 1, episodes=[10]

there are three kinds of error that can occur here it seems. The first kind occurs if the user type in the wrong type of event. The second is that the index is incorrect.

So far I thnk the code is good, I can see that there is a change from storing date time status structures to using entire clonable events instead. I think this will be helpful later down the line when we need to sort stuff as now to access the repeated events, they have a similar structure

Overall I think the code on the whole is good. I can see that it will filter out all events that fall on the day the program is run. I noticed that the remind command is in the while loop.

Sam I think you got to make this private and make use of getters and setters, bcus i dont think it's good practice to make class members private.

Sean just one question over here ah, we will only able to accept one param over here issit?  something like "select t/2". But will this block of code be able to accept a command like "deadline t/2 d/2020-10-18" where there are two params ?

yeah dude, as for now we are using strings for the priorities ryt and I'm assuming the priorities we'll be assigning to the respective tasks will be numbers since that was how it was mentioned in the user guide. So as for now I'm just sorting the tasks by comparing their priority strings and it will arrange every task in ascending order.

Oh I added it bc otherwise, when I use the add command function, it asks for the user input for the content of the note. So when loading the files I dont want to ask for the user input, therefore check if a content file exists (aka are we loading the data) and accordingly see where to get the content from

I think the moduleCode should not be set as final for future extendibility, so in case if the user has already typed in the expected and actual time for a module, and after that the user realises the module code is wrong, the user can edit the module code if the module code is not final, but still retain the expected and actual time.

Based on what I see from the coding standard, the first word after the variable name should be capitalized. For example in this case the "user" word. This applies for param, return, throws, etc.

Also, every line of the JavaDocs should end with a period. Think you missed out some, might want to double check.

But then like if I run "project /view" from the start it still exits with error even though got assert, then I can only fix it with try-catch block. Also if I replace the "no project" errors from try-catch to assertion then the error message prints but the task is still added. I'm not sure if this is normal behavior. Maybe assertions cannot replace try-catch?

The error was because there is no check whether there is a project before executing _ViewProjectCommand_. The error has already been fixed by @gmit22 in his latest PR.

Removing of sprint is deemed inefficient as it will produce gaps in the Sprint Manager. The user will be able to fulfil the same purpose by reallocating/removing the task and editing the Sprint goal if necessary.

This can happen if your academic calendar has modules and grades and if those modules do not have a cumulative GPA of 5 in the first place.

For eg, if in the first semester I scored a GPA of 4.8, even if i score CAP 5 for the remaining 7 semesters, my CAP will never be 5.0.

Please advise on the academic plan you have entered prior to this CAP Calculator set target command,

For Command part, I only added the editModuleCommand
For ModuleManager part, I only added a function to change the module code of the target module.
For Parser part, I only added a regex to match for editModuleCommand, and a prepareEditModuleCommand() to deal with user inputs
In the end, I added some Junit tests since it is the only way to test. 

PS: I edited your Module class and added a module description attribute

I decided that Lesson will be a sub class of Task. Lesson objects are special in the sense that they have a frequency. For now, I only considered the case where the Lessons are held weekly. Biweekly Lessons might be harder to implement, will think through again. Adding the Lesson class and enabling it to be added to the ScheduleManager and ModuleManager was the main bulk of what I tried to implement.

I still haven't changed the Deadline and Event classes to suit our TP code, which means as of now, Deadline and Event objects cannot be added to the ScheduleManager and ModuleManager yet. I also haven't added Junit tests and update the UserGuide.

At the bottom of ModuleManager, should put all sorts of task under it - Lesson, Deadlines and Events. 
At the bottom of ScheduleManager, should just put in the Deadlines -  should put down deadlines today and future as well. Will think of how to implement this and  update later

I have amended the UG explaining this. @adinata15 this diagram only serve as building user's intuition to use our app, it is not meant to be a ppt overview of 'dynamic' list. For that matter, the user can in fact read the `focus` section to see all the dynamic list we have, in which i have specified this in the UG.

Hi.

It is expected behavior. Because you do not yet have tasks with indixes 1 and 2.

Try this:

todo myTask1
deadline myDeadline 1 /by 10 10 2020
list

you will be able to see the task list with indices.

Then you will be able to use “add” command to add tasks with indices to the modules.

Best Regards
Bozhao

In short, you need to ***create tasks before trying to add tasks to modules***. The program works as expected in showing "NOT FOUND" when no specified task can be found, and showing "index out of range" when your specified index is indeed out of range. Those are expected error handling behaviors.

> I used the exact same command as the example, still cannot add

Hi. Would you mid providing a screenshot?

Firstly, you must indeed have tasks before you can try to add tasks to modules, otherwise of course the program need to show an error message.

Try this:

todo testTask1
todo testTask2
todo testTask3
list

Then you should be able to see that you have some tasks in the task list.
then, you can add the specified tasks to specified modules:

add -task 1 2 -mod EE2026

Should you need further clarifications, please do not hesitate to respond to this thread. Thanks!

Thank you for your valuable feedback. Please report this unintuitive documentation on CATcher as a Documentation Bug. We will improve the UG in the future based on your advice.

This is working perfectly fine as expected... because ***for your newly downloaded jar there is ZERO TASK created, and the index 1 and 2 are SURELY out of range.*** 

You can try reading my previous reply.

For your convenience I am going to paste it here:
''''

YOU DO REALIZE THAT 2020 IS EARLER THAN 2021 RIGHT?
BRO??????
LIST DATE ASC WORKS AS EXPECTED.

UI ALSO WORKS AS EXPECTED BECAUSE IT IS DESIGNED TO KEEP YOUR LAST ERROR MESSAGE SO THAT YOU CAN REFER TO IT WHEN TYPING THE NEXT COMMAND.

Anyways since the user finds the UI unintuitive I will change the UI. But the list function works as intended and need not change.

No, this is incorrect. The program only maintains 2 data lists, list of tasks and list of ALL modules.
It also maintains a dynamic list, the "target" list (linked by reference to the 2 data lists).
"focus" on other apparent lists (selected, taken, completed, etc.) just applies filters to the 2 data lists and collect the results to the "target" list.
All operations are directly operating the "target" list, with their effects propogating back to the data lists.

Oh this one the idea is to make a stack of questions in jumbled order - that's why first shuffle then make a stack out of it. So it's like pre-determined order, but to the user it will be "random". Implementation-wise, it's just popping off the topmost question from the "jumbled" stack. Idk if this answers your question?

Thanks for your input! Anywhere section is for generic commands that have same effect regardless of user's location within application. `help` commands are unique and distinct across different modes, which explains the decision to place it within each mode, rather than within the "Anywhere" section.

Understand! But we need to ensure that users give a valid input. e.g. they change the number of seasons to 0. If we assume the user input is perfect, then it will work well.

The most fail-safe method is to create the map with the actual index of each module inside the full module list after loading. This causes an efficiency of o(n) but allows for the most robust map creation as the index in the map will always correspond to the index in the array list.

Thank you for the suggestion @Jingming517. We designed PlanNUS as a platform that provides its user with all the information needed to make the best decision. Due to this, we decided not to implement a limit for users when it comes to suggesting which modules they should SU as more information is often better in this situation. Nonetheless, we appreciate the suggestion and will look into it for future iterations of PlanNUS.

My point here is that if we did choose a linked list structure then we would have no templates so we just add the components directly to the linked list. Of course, we could block users from adding certain components by checking the components present in the linked list. For some reason, I feel like a linked list interpretation would have worked. Any specific reason why it wouldn't be able to simulate a circuit system?

Hi Rachel, thank you for your recommendation. I would like to clarify that in our project, the user is registered once at the beginning of every session. When the user starts creating an essay or a poem, it would be recorded as the essay or the poem written by a certain user. Hence, I think it's better for listing the name of the User as a Writing's attribute (in this case as its author)

I enabled it from settings, and also ran someone's test code which show the thing is enabled. But then like if I run "project /view" from the start it still exits with error even though got assert, then I can only fix it with try-catch block. Also if I replace the "no project" errors from try-catch to assertion then the error message prints but the task is still added. I'm not sure if this is normal behavior. Maybe assertions cannot replace try-catch?

Just checked again, the code is working as expected now.


> You are talking about the Unit Test assertions is it? Those assertions are different from the normal assertions. Normal assertions are placed in the code using the `assert` keyword, therefore the link I have provided only works for normal assertions. Anyway both have different purpose, so yeah.

I think the problem is I did not pull Gunit's latest code. Now everything looks good.

I made more changes regarding some commands without dashes, so maybe can review one more time before merge.

Thanks for the suggestion.

I have tried to implement the saving of the list into the project class, but now it will cause nullpointerexception when launching scrumptious with the presence of data.json. Any idea what issue this might be? I feel that my tojson and fromjson is very similar if not identical to the ones used in the sprint classes.

Edit: Gradle fail due to failed test classes as a result of nullpointerexception

There is something similar if you type "-" into commands with no arguments at all e.g. "task /priorityview". It can filter extra stuff like "task /priorityview 2" will return error message but if you type "task /priorityview -2" the command just ignores the "-2".
