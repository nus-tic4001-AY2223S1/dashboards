I think perhaps it is because you use the ArrayList, but you did not declare the generic. 
Since generic does not do type-check and  you did not declare either, it gave such warning.

Maybe you can try this: whenever you have ..\bin, you change it to ..\circus\bin

The responseSense does not detect branch unless it has been merged to master and pushed to the remote. You just merge your level-five one hour ago and I think you can check the progress tomorrow. 

And similar for the tags, it might be that your tag for the levels does not point to commits in the main branch. Try checking if all the commits of the relevant tags can be found on your main branch. Tag the merging commits, instead of the branch commit.

In my iP, I wanted to use some text files as resources, containing some (not user-generated) data for my program. In the IDE, I was able to do so using the normal Files method, but this doesn't work with accessing files within a jar, as seen in #51 . 

I followed the tutorials online, but I couldn't seem to get the IDE to package the resources folder inside my jar, no matter what I tried. Finally, after poking around in the project settings, here's what I found out you have to do:

0. Create a resources folder under `src/main`, and put the resources you will need in that directory. 

1. Go to File -> Project Structure

2. Go to Modules on the left

3. Go to the Sources tab on the right

4. Find your resources folder

5. Select the resources folder, and then click on "Mark as: Resources"

6. Click OK

Now whenever you build the project, or build a JAR, it will also include the resources folder and you can use it correctly. 

(NB. This might be super obvious but it sure wasn't to me yesterday when I spent four hours trying to figure it out)

<panel  header="**2. :fas-info-circle: [General] Forking vs Branching for group projects**" popup-url="https://github.com/nus-cs2113-AY2021S1/forum/issues/44" expanded>

As NUS SoC students, we all have to do many group projects, most of which involve collaborating on code. I've used GitHub in the past for this, but mostly in the very simple "everyone just commits to master" style. Of course, with CS2113T, we're all now more familiar with advanced git and revision control strategies. 

Prof, can I ask, in your opinion, for the type of small group project that we often undertake, what's the best approach of these:

- Creating a GitHub Organisation for the project and creating a repository under the organisation that everyone contributes to via forks and PRs. 
- One member making a repository on their account and everyone making a fork and submitting PRs. 
- One member making a repository on their account and everyone making a separate branch and submitting PRs. 
- One member making a repository on their account and everyone committing to a separate "development" branch, and then submitting PRs to master.
- Committing directly to master. 

While PRs are very good for organising code, I think they can be a bit of a hassle for smaller projects where speed is more important than code quality (as long as there are no bugs, which should be tested before committing). I wonder if Prof has any advice on choosing an approach? Or maybe any of my classmates have any ideas/stories/suggestions? 

Thank you all in advance, have a lovely weekend!

I was looking through the RepoSense dashboard with all of our iPs, and I noticed that my iP is quite behind (the last commit was on 4th September). However, I have made more commits to my iP since then (including on the same day) but those don't seem to be picked up by RepoSense.

https://nus-cs2113-ay2021s1.github.io/website/schedule/week3/topics.html#key-exercise-pass-objects-to-move-method

The instructions for creating the move method specifies the following behaviour:

>* Returns null and does nothing if either p or r is null
>* Returns a new Point object that has attributes x and y that match those of r
>* Does not modify p
>* Updates r so that its attributes x and y match those of p

I think the instructions do not make clear whether the returned Point object should have attributes x and y matching those of r before the modification or after. 

The expected output seems to indicate that it is the former; that is, the method returns the previous/initial position of the rectangle as a Point. There's also little point (no pun intended) in directly returning one of the parameters. 

Perhaps the written instructions could be made slightly more explicit in mentioning this?

Hi Prof,

Week 3 Ex2 on repl.it requires us to calculate the area of a rectangle object, by multiplying its height and width together. Is it recommended to use the getter methods for the dimensions of the rectangle, or to just directly access the height and width variables? I noticed the model solution used the latter approach, but I used the getter methods myself. 

The comments in the skeleton code suggest using the setter for changing the dimensions rather than directly modifying the member variables, so I'm wondering why the model solution accessed the member variables directly rather than using the getters. 

Thank you, have a great day!

I installed OpenJDK using the AdoptOpenJDK installer, linked [here](https://adoptopenjdk.net/). I chose OpenJDK 11 and Hotspot JVM. 

Simply downloading and running the installer should, in theory, configure everything as necessary. By default, the installer will add the JDK to the PATH, so you should not need to perform any additional setup, except configuring your IDE (IntelliJ IDEA or whatever you might be using) to use the appropriate JDK.

The first link on [this](https://nus-cs2113-ay2021s1.github.io/website/admin/tools.html) page, which appears to link to https://nus-cs2113-ay2021s1.github.io/website/admin/urt_gitter, leads me to a 404 page on GitHub, while the other link https://gitter.im/nus-cs2113-AY2021S1/community takes me to a 404 on the Gitter website. 

Is the chat just not up yet?

Interesting update: If I use IntelliJ to automatically import each class (i.e. delete my import com.neilbaner.duke.exceptions.* and then Alt-Enter on each exception manually), then by the time I import every single exception (eg. import com.neilbaner.duke.exceptions.TaskIndexOutOfBoundsException, com.neilbaner.duke.exceptions.UnknownCommandException etc. etc, IntelliJ decides that it should combine them all back into com.neilbaner.duke.exceptions.*. This does throw a bit of a spanner in the works.

For mine, there are some text files containing lists of application data (i.e. not user generated data) that I want to bundle with the application. I made sure that those text files are inside the jar, but the same path that works when running in IntelliJ don't work with the jar. Can I ask how we can access files within the jar?

It does this for me too intermittently, and it seems to go away by itself after a while or when I restart IntelliJ. For a program whose name is derived from "intelligent", it can be quite dense at times...

Chiming in to say that I faced this same issue and this was indeed the problem. For me it was because I was working on the project across multiple computers, and the default .gitignore didn't push the manifest, and somehow somewhere along the line it got deleted.

If you made a User Guide with tables, you might be wondering why the formatting for the tables works in GitHub but breaks in GitHub pages. Following the advice at this link - https://github.com/pages-themes/cayman/issues/82 - you just need to change the '_config.yml' file to render with 'GFM' (GitHub Flavored Markdown). [More details found here.](https://help.github.com/en/github/working-with-github-pages/setting-a-markdown-processor-for-your-github-pages-site-using-jekyll)

As for adding emojis  like seen at [this link](https://github.com/ikatyang/emoji-cheat-sheet/blob/master/README.md) to your GitHub pages, there is an extra step explained at [this link](https://docs.github.com/en/enterprise/2.13/user/articles/emoji-on-github-pages) for the change needed in the '_config.yml' file.

For example, if you were using the Cayman theme, you could do something like this:
''' yml
theme: jekyll-theme-cayman
markdown: GFM
plugins:
  - jemoji
'''

The '_config.yml' file should be automatically created in the 'docs' folder and committed when you choose a theme for your User Guide, but you'll have to add the extra stuff yourself.

Also, here's a use of the emoji and table combination - nice informational boxes:

OS: Windows 10
Increment: ['A-TextUiTesting'](https://nus-cs2113-ay2021s1.github.io/website/schedule/week4/project.html#a-textuitesting)
File: 'runtest.bat'

While working on the increment, I find an issue when using file compare ('FC') for the special characters '✓' and '✘'. In the output file 'ACTUAL.TXT', the corresponding characters seem to get converted to '?' (question mark), and the follow lines will be shown in the diff:
'''
Comparing files ACTUAL.TXT and EXPECTED.TXT

------------------------------------------------------------
***** EXPECTED.TXT
 Nice! I've marked this task as done:

------------------------------------------------------------
*****
'''
To fix it, I basically had to change the the expected character to be a '?' in 'EXPECTED.TXT' and it will give me that no differences were encountered. However, this would mean that the test cannot check for '✓' and '✘' characters being different.

I guess that the error probably comes from the special characters being unicode characters which is an issue if 'FC' isn't expecting it. From the [docs](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-server/administration/windows-commands/fc), there is an option for unicode, but it will be on the whole file and not just a single character.

I also note that in [Updating test as the program evolves](https://se-education.org/guides/tutorials/textUiTesting.html#updating-tests-as-the-program-evolves), "we accept that the actual behavior should be the new expected behavior".

Is there any way for the test to check for those characters, or should I just stick with the question marks?

Other than the given ones regarding 'descriptionPrefix', 'printingDescription()', and 'important', these should be the other ones:

- 'pastDescription' should be 'pastDescriptions' to indicate collection

Hey, i think perhaps this will work:

`java -Dfile.encoding=UTF-8 -classpath ..\bin main\java\Duke < input.txt > ACTUAL.TXT`

It seems that because your compilation destination is <root>\bin but the package main.java was compiled and not the files, the classpath is ..\bin but you need to execute the `<package>.<subpackage>.<main class>`.

See also: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/7509295/noclassdeffounderror-wrong-name/13697239

If this still doesn't work, try changing your javac command in runtest.bat to:

to see what files or packages are being loaded.

I personally feel using explicit imports is still better; on top of the stated benefits, I feel it is also more flexible in that it allows you to more clearly and easily remove particular import statements in the event you reorganize your packages and/or the code in the class to which you are importing the packages/classes to.

Honestly think this should be perfectly sound and acceptable, although it isn't exactly specified in most places I've looked (including all the [reference links at the bottom of the SE-EDU Java coding standard page](https://se-education.org/guides/conventions/java/basic.html#references)). 

The alternative to indexing your array would be to write something like `int nameIndex = 0; int dateIndex = 1` which for a 2-element array feels like it actually makes the code a little less readable.

A _possibly_ relevant section I found is in [this doc](https://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/codeconventions-150003.pdf) under section 10.3, but no explicit mention of array indexing.

Agree this is not so clear cut, so would also like to see what the general recommendation is.

so your branch-A-Packages is found but not branch-Level-5? Might it be due to a small typo in the uppercase 'L', given that the name technically should be `branch-level-5`? Don't know if they accounted for typos like this.

from your commit history it seems you created the `branch-A-Packages` branch from `branch-Level-5`, but i think we are supposed to merge `branch-Level-5` into `master`, `git checkout master`, then `git branch branch-A-Packages` or `git checkout -b branch-A-Packages` from `master`.

As for **multiline code blocks** within markdown tables, can try:

`<pre><code>list<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ____________________________________________________________<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Here are the tasks in your list:<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1.[D][✓] test (by: Sep 24 2020 11:59 PM)<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;____________________________________________________________</code></pre>`

**Note: `&nbsp;`s can be replaced with normal spaces ` `.

which renders to (if used in a table cell)

For some reasoning about the above code, 
- [`<pre>` tags displays the text in a fixed-width font, and the text preserves both spaces and line breaks.](https://www.w3schools.com/tags/tag_pre.asp)
- `<code>` tags are needed here to inject the code block, and also so we can use HTML elements like `<br>` within
- `&nbsp;` is a space that cannot be broken by word wrap, but here it should be ok to replace it with normal spaces since `<pre></pre>` should handle this
- `<br>` are placed wherever a line break is needed

It's not specified so I personally assumed it's up to the individual's discretion: my tp mate implemented error-checking to only allow the strict date formatting but I personally coded it such that if you get the right format (i.e. YYYYMMDD) the program converts it, otherwise it just uses whatever the user entered (e.g. in 10min). Either way, include it in your user guide!

When implementing the JAR file, I encounter the FileNotFoundException. When I tried on the normal java terminal everything works, with or without the duke.txt. Is this something we need to fix or is this ok? My code is as follows:
'''

        File pastFile = new File(filepath); // create a File for the given file path

I try changing it to:
'''
java -Dfile.encoding=UTF-8 -classpath ..\bin main\java\Duke < input.txt > ACTUAL.TXT
'''
The same error still comes out. However, when I change it to:

'''
It works :D. I then try to change all backslash to slash in the runtime.bat file and it also works. I am not really sure why this works, but could this lead to a problem in the future?

Maybe it is because of different line endings? In windows, the files have CRLF at the end of lines, and in MacOS/Linux they end with LF. I think `dos2unix` is supposed to fix this but it failed to run because your system doesn't have it.

Hi, can I ask why IntelliJ treats some of my methods used in other classes as unused? I ctrl-click the method and it says no usage found, but if I ctrl-click the method in where I actually use it, it will refer back to the greyed out method.  My classes are also in grey color while I actually have used them.

If yours looks like this where you have a main.java folder with all the classes inside it, you may need to change the runtest.bat file:

instead of writing:
`java -classpath ..\bin Duke < input.txt > ACTUAL.TXT`
you will need to write:
`java -classpath ..\bin main.java.Duke < input.txt > ACTUAL.TXT`
Im not sure if this will help, but it did help me resolve the issue of missing classes. Do let me know how it goes

<panel  header="**2. :fas-info-circle: Question regarding traditional task method for Level-4**" popup-url="https://github.com/nus-cs2113-AY2021S1/forum/issues/32" expanded>

Hi,
I was wondering whether we are supposed to retain the traditional task entry feature (e.g. type anything, added as task) as we code Level-4. This seems redundant since the old task method seems to be identical to "ToDo" tasks now.

Also, may I ask how strictly should we stick to the example outputs? It seems possible to detect the types of tasks automatically by looking for the "by" and "at" keywords in the string itself, but I'm not sure if such implementation/deviation from example output is allowed. (This method will follow the input of Level-2/Level-3)

Thanks for any advice regarding these queries.

@okkhoy Thanks for the clarification. 

Regarding the second part, I meant to write the program such that it automatically categorizes the type of task by detecting "/at" and "/by" (or the lack thereof) on the input so that the user does not need to enter specifically the type of task(e.g. typing `project meeting /at Mon 2-4pm` instead of  `event project meeting /at Mon 2-4pm`). However, since the Level-2 commands are retained, I am uncertain of how the automated categorization can distinguish (or is required to distinguish) between a Level-2 "task" and To-Do since they seem like the same thing. Is it a better idea to stick with the guidelines provided by the sample output?

@daniellimws  @okkhoy 
Apologies for the delayed reply. I just realized my issue is the result of my blunder of forking @okkhoy 's Circus fork instead of the one at `https://github.com/nus-cs2113-AY2021S1/circus`. I have since re-done the activity with the correct fork and everything seems to work now.

Appreciate the help provided.

@okkhoy 
I was mistaken that the `https://github.com/nus-cs2113-AY2021S1/circus` project (I probably shouldn't have called that the 'main branch') had been updated with an `in-lecture` branch when in actual fact I accidentally forked your fork instead. Apologies for the inconvenience caused.

I think you need to include all the other packages/classes for it to be compiled properly.

i.e. by adding ```../src/main/java/duke/task/*.java``` into the end of the line and for all the other classes.

My code is printing exactly the same thing (a same string consisting of ansi escape codes) without the use of user input, so there shouldnt be a difference. Also, I cannot reproduce the error on my pc (always no difference) and I have no idea of what I could do to reproduce it. 
also, I'm wondering why it shows dos2unix command not found instead of showing me my output is unexpected.

This problem has been occuring forever. The only way to pass is to print nothing at all. As long as something is printed, the test will fail. I can not find the difference between two files. Using fc command and diff command locally both says they are the same.

Hi,

I don't really understand about why the example code for the increment A-MoreOOP initialises instances of classes instead of just using static methods.

For example, it initialises a instance `ui` of class `Ui` to print things, but couldn't we achieve the functionality of printing things with static methods?

Would like to know if there's any benefits of using instances of classes instead of static methods in these cases that I'm missing.

Hi, I was merging branch-Level-6 to master branch but did not check the "Create a new commit even if fast forward is possible". It resulted in something like this:

Then I did a **git reset --keep branch-Level-6@{1}** but was unable to revert back to the previous state before merging as the branch-Level-6 returned to the 2nd last commit in branch-Level-6 and master stayed at my last commit of branch-Level-6. So I merged master back into branch-Level-6 which went back into the situation shown in the picture above.  I was unable to revert the merge after that.

How do I move master back to origin/master? Would it be safe to checkout origin/master and reset master branch there? Or may I know if there is any other solution to this?

I faced the same issue and after implementing @wangqinNick solution, the terminal will still show '''Γ£ÿ''' and '''Γ£ô''' instead of '''✘''' and '''✓''' when I have yet to change the '''EXPECTED.txt''' to match '''ACTUAL.txt'''. But when I open '''ACTUAL.txt''' it shows '''✘''' and '''✓''' correctly. 
After I changed '''EXPECTED.txt''' to match '''ACTUAL.txt''', no differences will be detected when I run runtest.bat so I believe it is the terminal that is not able to show the correct symbol rather than java.

This is something new to me too as I thought the code that you have written for your constant is fine. I tried what you did and the check gave me the same warning. However, when I added 'static' before 'final' the check passed. So, I believe that constants should have the 'static' keyword in it and hence the check only passes such cases. 
Also, if you try to refactor something in your code into a constant, the IDE will automatically declare it with the 'static' key word in it, like so:
![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/49060098/95012506-b56cb600-066b-11eb-9cf0-fc38bbf5f438.png)

Below are some useful information I found about what static does and I hope this might explain why we need 'static' when declaring our constants. 
[StackOverflow (see the comment with 104 upvotes)](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/8093230/why-are-java-constants-declared-static#:~:text=If%20a%20constant%20is%20not,of%20the%20constant%20per%20object)

I have made my first commit to the forked project, with a summary "Update Level-0", but I didn't see any change in the dashboard. The last update is still on Mar 03 2020.

@gmit22 have you changed the font in your terminal to nsimsun?

Hi Prof, instead of using .txt file, can we use a .csv file to store the data on the local machine?
