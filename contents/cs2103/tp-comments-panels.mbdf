Instead of introducing this method within the model, perhaps it would be better for the methods that require a zero based number to use the currently available `Index` object and retrieve a `getOneBased()` value instead?

That is, the method that does the comparison should be the one performing the conversion from a zero based index to a one based index for comparison with the `Week` value.

Perhaps we should take in `Index` instead of `int` for week associated values (at least for this class since it sort of acts like an index to a list) so that there is less room for mistakes of getting the base wrong in the future?

Or since the `Week` class seems to be unused, perhaps the `Week` class can be used to store a valid (i.e. within 1 and 52 when counted from base 1)`Index` object. And the `Week` object can be used as the definitive way to check for validity and retrieve `AttendanceRecord` objects from the appropriate week/index.

For some of the tests here, it might be good to add simple `assert` statements to make sure that certain assumptions about the `model` are true.

Because of the need to include the `CURRENT_INDICATOR` for a particular entry, which is rather specific to `ViewHistoryCommand`, the method in `StringUtil` would be oddly specialised for a method in the `commons` package.

Hmm I wanted to differentiate this constructor from the previous as this constructor is typically not meant to be used to create new lessons, but rather act as a "copy" constructor with modifications.

I did consider the direct de/serialisation of key-value pairs using the Jackson, however I was rather hesitant to use it as I was unsure how it would play with the current implementation of `JsonUtil`. Similarly, the `StudentAttendance` implementation was used to avoid the need to complicate the deserialisation of key-value pairs.

I do agree with you that the direct serialisation would be more intuitive and provide a one to one mapping with the actual classes in the model.

I'm not sure if `<ins>` is the correct tag to use here? (And the closing tag should be `</ins>` right) From what I gathered online `<ins>` is to underline some text in html to indicate it is an insertion, but there's not `<del>` tag here, so I think it might be more appropriate to use either the `<u>` tag for underlining or `[]()` syntax if its supposed to be a link

From the [convention guide](https://se-education.org/guides/conventions/java/intermediate.html): Constant names must be all uppercase using underscore to separate words. I'm not sure if countryNotes should be marked `final` actually, since we are going to modify it in the `addCountryNote` function.

Also, I feel that the notes should be stored in something like a LinkedHashSet, since we don't really want to add in duplicate notes, and its easier to check if its a HashSet.

I feel like we shouldn't initialize countryNotes until it is actually needed. E.g. Only when the user actually adds a country note, or there are notes for this country in the save file. If not its unnecessary overhead, especially if there are many countries.

Constant names must be all uppercase using underscore to separate words.

Is there a need for this Map? From what I see, I think we can just keep the ISOCountry String array, then check if the entered String is inside, before initializing a new Locale with that String. This way, we won't have to keep so many country objects, since most of the countries likely won't be used.

Hmmmm seems like by `constant` they mean static final only. Static only or final only aren't counted as constants, even though one of the examples in the website has an example of final only variables being set to all caps + underscores.

Should we standardize comments? One possible style:

Separate-line comment with whitespace, singular verb, and uppercase 1st character.

```
// Parses user input...
Command command = addressBookParser.parseCommand(commandText);
```

Same-line comment with whitespace, singular verb, and lowercase 1st character.

I know this is a bit late, but do you think we should change `AddPersonCommand` to `AddPatientCommand`?

I think our `Person` refers specifically to `Patient` since we have the `periodOfStay` field. If we are adding a `Staff` class in the future, it may be a little misleading since `Staff` is a `Person` too.

Do you think an Enum may be preferable here since there are a limited number of possible values?

Using `int` is not very scalable. If we have 10 different search conditions, we would need 10 `int`, and it can be hard to keep track of these variables.

Perhaps we can declare a nested Enum:

```
private enum SearchCondition {
    SEARCH_BY_NAME.
    SEARCH_BY_TEMPERATURE,
    SEARCH_CONDITION_INVALID; // no condition or multiple conditions given
}
```

If you would like to use `int`, maybe it would be better to make them static and change the variable names to indicate they are constants. E.g.

```
private static final int SEARCH_BY_NAME = 1;
```

Personally, I think Enum might be neater. 😄

It is less about whether the user will enter a negative number, and more about how we should secure our application.

Personally, I feel that it is good if we can handle as many exceptional cases (sometimes called edge cases) as possible. Without proper handling, anyone can crash the app simply by entering a negative number. It can be annoying for the user if they accidentally type in a negative number and the app just stops working.

Besides, near the end of the semester, our application will be manually tested for bugs. I am fairly sure the testers will try to use negative numbers as inputs. If they can cause the application to crash, they will flag the problem as a bug and deduct our marks for it. Let's do our best to stop that from happening! 😄

I think it is easier to understand if you iterate through all the `Room` objects in a loop and call an `isEmpty()` method to determine which `Room` is empty.

Because `isSamePatient(...)` uses name, age, and phone number as criteria to detect duplicate `Patient` in a list, will this not pose a problem when deleting? It is possible to have more than 1 `Patient` with the same name after all. In that case, only the first matching `Patient` is deleted. 

I think it may be a little strange that the user cannot select which `Patient` to delete if they share the same name.  I am not sure about the optimal way to solve this problem. Would deleting by index be better?

I think maybe we can make this more general and apply it all the other *List classes (UniquePatientList, RoomList, TaskList). Otherwise, I think the interface may not be needed?

Possibly `ReadOnlyList<T>`? We can do either:

The condition for this is `rooms != null && roomList.rooms != null` but I think neither the `PriorityQueue` nor `ObservableList` can be `null` because of the default value, right?

Instead of tracking `numOfRooms` in a variable, would it be possible to just make use of the size of the `ObservableList`? Maybe include a method to get size (similar to the other *List classes).

`@JsonProperty` tells the Jackson ObjectMapper to map the JSON property name to the annotated Java field's name so we end up with this:

I think the current structure is not too bad. Maybe we can rename `clearRoom` to `isNewEmptyRoom` for clarity? `clearRoom` sounds like the name of a method hahaha.

I understand it may be easier to return an `Integer` but this method is similar to the `parseIndex`. We can use the `Index` class provided in the original codebase and use `parseIndex` instead.

Hmm if we modify `RoomList` directly from `EditRoomCommand`, we may be breaking a few abstraction barriers since `Command` will be interacting with `RoomList`.

To avoid this problem, we can add a `setRoom(Room target, Room editedRoom)` method to `RoomList`. Then, add another `setRoom(Room target, Room editedRoom)` method to `Model` (the interface). Finally, In `ModelManager`, call `roomList.setRoom(...)`.

We can then use the `setRoom(...)` method by calling `model.setRoom(...)`. So we are restricting the interactions between classes such that `Command` only interacts with `RoomList` via `Model`.

Okay, I see what you mean. For now, we are treating `RoomNumber` as an index but in the future we may allow the user to set their own room numbers.

`getRoomList()` returns the `ObservableList` though. Wouldn't it be possible to check if the room is present from there? 

I think one reason we would not want to return the `RoomList` is because it is mutable. That means that if we return `RoomList` from `ModelManager`, any other class can modify the content through `RoomList` (e.g. call `roomList.addRooms(...)`) instead of through the `Model` (i.e. call `model.addRooms(...)`).

`getRoomList()` returns a read-only list so we can prevent the contents of `RoomList` from being changed directly. In fact, I think that was the original intention behind the `asUnmodifiableObservableList()` method.

If I am not wrong, the two methods `getPatientIndex()` and `getPatientFromIndex()` are used in the `EditPatientCommand` class, right?

Instead of this

```
        Index index = model.getPatientIndex(patientToBeEdited);

        if (index.getZeroBased() == 0) {
            throw new CommandException(Messages.MESSAGE_INVALID_PATIENT_NAME_INPUT);
        }

        Patient patientToEdit = model.getPatientFromIndex(Index.fromZeroBased(index.getZeroBased() - 1));
```

Would it not be cleaner to do this in `EditPatientCommand`?

```
        Optional<Patient> optionalPatient  = model.getPatientWithName(patientToBeEdited);

        // Better still, use Patient patientToEdit = optionalPatient.orElseThrow(...). I forgot the syntax hahaha.
        if (!optionalPatient.isPresent()) {
            throw new CommandException(Messages.MESSAGE_INVALID_PATIENT_NAME_INPUT);
        }

        Patient patientToEdit = optionalPatient.get();
```

That way, we avoid using Index altogether.

Actually, we probably should have another class similar to `PatientRecord` to interact with `RoomList`. Add, delete, set are done through `PatientRecord` right now. I think it's fine for now though. Maybe add a note to move this method to the new class once it is set up.

Interestingly, `yyyyMd` does not work.

Consider the date "12 Jan 2020", for instance. With `yyyyMd`, it would be "2020112". But this string is ambiguous. Are we referring to "2 Nov 2020" or "12 Jan 2020"?

If we want to use `yyyyMd`, we would need a delimiter (e.g. `yyyy-M-d`). I decided against using the hyphen because it doesn't read as well when it is a date range.

Actually, yeah. It is probably not needed for an MVP.

The rationale behind adding `DateTimeCreated` is to allow the user to filter tasks with creation date as a criterion. For example, in [Slack](https://slack.com/intl/en-sg/solutions/task-management), users can see when the task is created. It is helpful when the user wants to query what tasks were created yesterday or within the last few days.

Right now, the plan is for the user to click on a `Room` in order to view all tasks assigned to it. There is no separate tab for the users to manage tasks (we should probably have this to show user which tasks from which rooms are due?). In the future, when we implement reminders or a search for tasks, `DateTimeCreated` might be more useful.

I think I will remove this from the MVP. Unit testing for this class also requires more work because we would need another layer of abstraction to handle and control the date-time instead of using `LocalDateTime.now()`.

Thoughts on this?

At first, I made it a non-abstract class, but then IntelliJ made noise because it extends abstract class Command so i either had to override the execute method in NegataCommand or make NegateCommand abstract. Since I personally felt that overriding the execute method in NegateCommand was a little redundant since the UnremindCommand, UnscheduleCommand and UndoneCommand will override the execute method again, I decided to make the NegateCommand class abstract.

I can change it back to a normal class if you want to though, I shall just override the abstract execute method in NegateCommand if you want to change it to a normal class :)

Added the following :

JsonAdaptedStudent.java
```
        if (uuid == null) {
            throw new IllegalValueException(String.format(MISSING_FIELD_MESSAGE_FORMAT, "uuid"));
        }
```

JsonAdaptedStudentTest.java
```
    @Test
    public void toModelType_invalidUuid_throwsIllegalValueException() {
        JsonAdaptedStudent student =
                new JsonAdaptedStudent(null, VALID_NAME, VALID_PHONE, VALID_EMAIL, VALID_TAGS);
        String expectedMessage = String.format(MISSING_FIELD_MESSAGE_FORMAT, "uuid");
        assertThrows(IllegalValueException.class, expectedMessage, student::toModelType);
    }
```

Since UUID is a built-in java class, instead of doing something like ```throw new IllegalValueException(String.format(MISSING_FIELD_MESSAGE_FORMAT, Name.class.getSimpleName()));``` , i opted for ```throw new IllegalValueException(String.format(MISSING_FIELD_MESSAGE_FORMAT, "uuid"));```

Currently since we are using UUID.randomUUID(), the edge case that could potentially happen is a null UUID rather than that of a UUID that is not specified properly, unless the user decides to edit the uuid in the json file to a smaller uuid string. Hence i decided to only test for toModelType_nullStudentIds_throwsIllegalValueException()

An example of an invalid UUID is ```"fffa3023-7d89-426b-ba01-" // No uuid values after dash```

since you are only counting the number of occupied rooms directly, will there be a problem with this? eg.
i have 3 rooms
* room 1
* room 2
* room 3

So lets say ``room 1`` and ``room 3`` are occupied. so ``numberOfRoomsOccupied = 2`` correct? But next time if you load the ``RoomBook``, it will give me ``room 1`` and ``room 2`` occupied since the ``numberOfRoomsOccupied`` is 2?

Yup, adhering to abstraction principle is good, however i feel it might not be worth it to extract only 2 lines of code into a new method. maybe what wl can do is to perhaps give a name to the variable to make it clearer.

because i have to check if the room is present in the ``ObservableList``. There is no way to access the ``RoomList`` other than through the ``ModelManager.java``. i don't think its suitable to have a method in ``ModelManager.java`` to check if the room exists and to return that room

i initially used ``hasRoom()`` and ``setRoom()``. i forgot why i didnt use ``hasRoom()`` but i didnt use ``setRoom()`` because roomList class already has ``setRooms()``, i feel that it will be quite confusing to have 2 methods named so closely to each other but does totally different things

Hmm, now thinking about it, it does seem like bad design. I'll change this later and update this pr. I will probably use the observablelist.stream().anyMatch to replace this (so it will stay in EditRoomCommand.java but won't have a method) . Do you think its a good idea?

This is one of the dilemma I'm facing. Whether to have a static method in RoomList.java or have a method in EditRoomCommand.java (that is out of place). I think i will adopt the same method of just using the observablelist.stream.anyMatch() method and not create a new method. How does it sound?

if i dont use `Index` class right, then i'll be using `integer` instead. cuz if i use `roomlist.getObservableList.indexOf(getPatientWithName("some name here")`, it will return `-1` if the patient is not found. but `Index` class doesnt accept negative integer, so it will throw out an exception

While the current deployment process works with personal access tokens, @wltan brought up the point that we should have it work with the repository token `GITHUB_TOKEN` instead. This is a more ideal solution, especially if Prof Damith were to adopt the use of `jekyll-spaceship`.

Define the allowed inputs for `Title` and `Category` more explicitly in the user guide. The intricacies of the input validation cannot be captured within `MESSAGE_CONSTRAINTS` without making it unnecessarily verbose which is not user friendly.

Just throwing out this alternative: perhaps placing the `Week` object here would be better instead of in the `JsonAdaptedAttendanceRecord` class. So instead of having a `List<JsonAdaptedAttendanceRecordList>` attribute, there can be a `Map<Week, JsonAdaptedAttendanceRecord>`. Jackson supports Json serialisation of `Map`s: https://www.baeldung.com/jackson-map. 

Purpose is for symmetry between the Model classes. And I think it may help in reducing lines of code and tests.

I think this current implementation is also suitable for purposes of this project.

Actually you can remove the isPersonFound attribute totally. if (personName.equals(nameToSearch) can just return new CommandResult(String.format(MESSAGE_SEARCH_PERSON_SUCCESS, personFound)) directly.

Will be good to include a MESSAGE_SUCCESS attribute or something similar for the string " rooms are added in a hotel" (can refer to the other command classes to see what I mean). 
E.g. in addPatientCommand your have the attribute String MESSAGE_SUCCESS = "New person added: %1$s";
So what you return is return new CommandResult(String.format(MESSAGE_SUCCESS, numPersonToAdd)) instead of the hardcoded string.

Ok actually I am kind of confused of the flow and purpose of the addNumberOfRooms command. I thought for first time user we will get them to initialise the number of rooms and that will be fixed through out the usage of the app. So addNumberOfRooms in this case should be for initialisation? It doesn't make sense if halfway throughout the usage of the app I suddenly call addNumberOfRooms command again unless I built more rooms for my facility. :/

I am not sure if it is a good idea to make this function static and expose it to the outer world, considering how you also need to call the getRoomList() function from the model to get the ObservableList<Room> as your parameter for this method so the roomList will be from your existing RoomList class anyway  :/.

Hmm I was thinking of having the function "isPatientAssignedARoom" in the Model interface instead. Since the Model contains roomList and the patientRecords, Model knowing whether isPatientAssignedARoom kind of makes sense (essentially it will call on another isPatientAssignedARoom method in the roomList class to get the result).  

I think the key here is that the command should only know of Model and should not be accessing roomList directly. (like the Law of Demeter that we learn for this week) That's what I intend to improve for my deletePatientCommand because I also accessed the patient list directly from model, but I think it's not very well designed since there's a deletePatient command directly from model (original code from address book).

I agree with Ming De I think we should stick to making sure patient does not have the same name. If we delete by index, in the case of 1000 entries, the user may have to scroll too much to find the patient (using searchpatient command doesn't show the index also :/). 
If we just ensure patient cannot have the same name, then all we need to change is the isSamePatient(...) function (to guard against duplicate patient being entered). If we need to check for the age and phone number identifiers, then we may need massive changes for deletepatient and editpatient command :/.
Well, we can justify that the odds of patients having the same name is really very slim haha (https://www.quora.com/What-is-the-probability-of-two-people-having-the-same-name-and-also-living-in-the-same-city)

But one thing to consider is that the entry that you are working on might disappear.

Let's say your filtered list only has one entry. If you edit that entry and it the project doesn't match the predicate anymore, the list will not be empty. This might be a little weird from a UX perspective.

I'm not sure whether we should fix this. What do the rest think?

Should `FrequentExpense` be a subtype of `Expense`? Consider the fact that they appear in different lists, and are treated very differently. Moreover a method to convert a `FrequentExpense` to an `Expense` is implemented .Also note that `FrequentExpense` should not have a `Date` field, since its date is undefined. Only the `Expense` that it converts to should have a date.

`ModelManager::filteredTransactions` was ideally supposed to contain both expenses and incomes from `FinanceTracker::expenses` and `FinanceTracker::incomes`, through the methods `FinanceTracker::getExpenseList` and  `FinanceTracker::getExpenseList` while completely omitting `FinanceTracker::transactions`. Thus, `ModelManager` would have 3 lists while `FinanceTracker` would have 2.

However, the implementation of the class `FilteredList` is that one of its fields (`source`) is an `ObservableList` object, and constructing a `FilteredList` as such:
```java
ObservableList<E> observableList = FXCollections.observableArrayList()
FilteredList<E> filteredList = new FilteredList(observableList);
```
would result in `source = observableList`.

In essence, a `FilteredList` object needs to keep track of an `ObservableList` object.

Thus, `filteredTransactions` needs to keep track of its own `ObservableList` object, and cannot track both `expenses` and `incomes` together. Therefore, `FinanceTracker::transactions` cannot be removed, and neither can the class `TransactionList`.

Possible solutions:
* Add a switch statement that refreshes the tab after every command.
* Modify `CommandResult` to indicate any changes.
* Make use of listener, somehow.
* Add additional getters for the lists or for the transactions based on index.

The rationale behind using java String#trim on `Phone` was to remove leading and trailing whitespaces. When considering the user's `dateTime` input do we need to consider white spaces inside the string as well? For e.g. "01-01-2020 1200" vs "01-01-2020   1200" if we are not going to trim it then perhaps we need to consider adding an exception for this and add the corresponding unit test.

A few problems I found: 
`find status: XXX` where XXX is an invalid input, returns 0 tasks found as well

Error message displayed should state that status can only be of 2 values: complete and incomplete.

`find date:01-01-202` is also accepted and the date 01-01-2020 matches it, should this be considered an incorrect input

Perhaps we can use camelCase for the property names? JSON properties are basically hashmap keys; so just like how we wouldn't use multiple words (with spaces) in a key or variable name (altho JS/JSON allows), maybe we can use `moduleCode` or `module_code` instead?

**Not a suggestion/request for change**, but I was just wondering why the original code does this redundant check here when it could just call gradPad's `setModules` fxn, which already uses `UniqueModuleList` to ensure all modules are unique.

I just put this comment here first in case we want to improve code quality next time.

```suggestion
List<Modules> gradPadModules = modules.stream().map(JsonAdaptedModule::toModelType).collect(Collectors.toList());
try {
    gradpad.setModules(gradPadModules);
} catch (DuplicateModuleException ex) {
    throw new IllegalValueException(MESSAGE_DUPLICATE_MODULE);

I think that there is no need to create a separate exception for wrong date. Instead, parseException should be used.

This copy of valid visit is hard coded, by using the visit builder class. The hard coded values are retrieved using the getOneBased method. Valid visit has no direct reference to filtered visit at all.

The gist of this test is that my model's filtered lists for person and location currently store only 1 location with id 3 and 1 person with id 4. This is done using the showLocationAtIndex, showPersonAtIndex methods above. Im giving the model input using index 1 and index 1 for person and location, because the list user sees contains only 1 element. After processing however, I am expecting the visit to point to ids 3 and 4 respectively. This is done by comparing the final visit from the visit list with the expected visit created using valid visit.

Pull Request Approval:

Before approving any pull requests, please ensure the following is done.

1. Eyeballing the code for any possible logic or other errors. This is also to familiarise yourself with implementation of the system.

2. Pull the pull request down into a local branch and give the features a test run. This is to check whether it actually works since eyeballing code may not be fool proof in ensuring functionality.

Looks like you're using the assertion incorrectly, it should be
`assert amount >= 0 : "amount cannot be negative";` instead.

Currently it will print the error message regardless of whether the assertion passed or failed.

Nope, if you try to declare multiple of the same parameters there will be an assertion error somewhere.

Technically you can work around this, by declaring a new class that contains the two parameters, e.g.
the command:
`takeTwoIntegers 1 2`
may have a parameter
`private Parameter<IntPair> param = this.addParameter(..., IntPair::parse)`

and the IntPair class is as follows:
```java
class IntPair {
  public int a;
  public int b;
  public parse(String str) {
    IntPair result = new IntPair();
    result.a = ...
  }
```

Don't think any of our commands will involve these kinds of parameters, but if they do we may have to either redesign the command or the parser. (We'll solve that problem when it happens)

Preliminary findings:

 This is actually a symptom of a much bigger problem: **the code is violating SRP and Seperation of Concerns.**

## Context
Right now the model classes (i.e. `Fridge`, `UniqueFoodList`) are throwing these `RuntimeExceptions` when the food being added is a duplicate etc.

The reason why this has not been a problem so far is because (for the case of the `DuplicateFoodException`) the 2 classes that add to the food list/fridge, the `AddCommand` and `EditCommand` have guard clauses that throw an error when a duplicate food item is being added.

```java
if (!(foodToEdit.equals(editedFood)) && model.hasFood(editedFood)) {
    throw new CommandException(MESSAGE_DUPLICATE_FOOD);
}
```
*this one*

Frankly this shouldn't be the job of the `EditCommand` or `AddCommand` and now we have to include extra tests to ensure these guard clauses work.

Using the current design, in the future if we add more `Commands` or other functionality that add `food` items to the `model`, we will have to keep in mind to catch these duplicates ourselves else oopsies! the program will explode because `Fridge` threw a `RuntimeException`.

It is my firm belief that since Java so benevolently offers to handle these problems for us (with checked exceptions), we forgetful humans should gracefully accept its help.

**Note:** I just remembered we're allowing duplicates now but the above argument still applies to the other `FoodNotFoundException`.

## Proposed Change
Recall the current guard clause used:
```java
if (!(foodToEdit.equals(editedFood)) && model.hasFood(editedFood)) {
    throw new CommandException(MESSAGE_DUPLICATE_FOOD);
}
```
If `DuplicateFoodException` is thrown as a checked exception, we can easily wrap it in a try-catch:
```java
try {
    // do the adding here or wtv nonsense
} catch (DuplicateFoodException e) {
    throw new CommandException(MESSAGE_DUPLICATE_FOOD);
}
```

Copied over the justification from AB3

```
PersonNotFoundException is a checked exception. It is thrown by methods
such as `UniquePersonList#remove(Person)`,
`UniquePersonList#setPerson(Person, Person)` etc. to signify that
certain preconditions were not met -- namely that the person provided to
those methods does not exist in the address book/UniquePersonList.

Using checked exceptions for such a purpose is slightly useful in that
it will force callers to handle the case where the above preconditions
are not met, such as when the methods are called with invalid user
input.

However, it imposes a HUGE cost on callers where the preconditions are
already known to be met (e.g. in test code, or when the user input has
already been validated before hand). In such a case, callers are forced
to add try-catch blocks around the method call even if they know that
the exception will never be thrown, bloating up the code. It is also
impossible to test the catch blocks as well since correct code will
ensure that the precondition holds and thus the exception will never be
thrown, leading to reduced code coverage.

Checked exceptions also don't work very well with the Java Streams API,
since the API doesn't accept lambdas which could throw checked
exceptions.

In AB-4, the amount of code which benefits from PersonNotFoundException
being a checked exception is much smaller than the amount of code which
is negatively impacted.

As such, let's make the tradeoff in the other direction, by making
PersonNotFoundException a RuntimeException. New callers _could_ forget

Only argument I agree with is the `Java Streams` one, but we can work around this.

Does each class really need to know the `COMMAND_TYPE` string? It seems like it would be better to just have the AddressBookParser store the main `COMMAND_TYPE` string variants. Either that, or these classes should be taking the AddressBookParser's `COMMAND_TYPE` definition. Because right now, to change the `COMMAND_TYPE` string, every single file has to be edited

My suggestion was actually to not have this at all. But the enum-type would probably be the second best alternative as both `AddressBookParser` and the relevant commands will depend on the String specified in the enum-type. Because as is right now, the current implementation is the equivalent of the cyclic dependency you mentioned, just not strictly coded in. If you change `AddressBookParser`'s string to detect `Contact`-type commands, then you'll still have to change those within each `Contact`-type command class.

If you're removing references to the Command-type string inside the Command classes themselves, then the reconstruction of user input tests have to be moved to `AddressBookParserTest` instead. The individual Command-types will handle only their own share of input (everything that is after `{command name} {contact/event}`

I think only one enumeration is sufficient (CommandType). Because 'add' is a unique identifier for the AddContactCommand, or at least it was. But I feel like the reason both `AddressBookParser` and the individual command classes should not hold the contact identifier's specific implementation within them is that it is a property that they all share and depend on. So a separate enumeration would fit this. 
 
I change my mind regarding holding references within the command classes themselves to their CommandType. It does make recreating the command for testing easier.

> i think there is merit in having the test cases remain in their current classes as they are intended to test certain classes.

I don't think this is really relevant to the discussion because the individual command classes don't actually use their own command word and command type for testing. Only `AddressBookParserTest` uses them to recreate it.

Is the sort method supposed to sort the current shown list? Or is it supposed to sort the full list of contacts before showing it? Because the former would be much easier to implement and I believe is what we intended to do originally? There is the `model.getFilteredPersonList()` method which gives the last shown list.

Also, I agree with the Hendey's comment about the sortPerson method. I do not think that all the model classes need to have such a method.

> Looks good to me. I'm just wondering how the TagManager class helps to keep track of the participants (persons) of a particular event without implementing necessary changes in Calendar class or respective events class?

This was done mostly with the context of supporting Bangyi's delete by tag and add to events by tag. Shouldn't the `Event`'s class have references to the `Tag`s it contains similar to the `Person`s it contains? Anyway I believe someone else is implementing this. This was just to help support that.

I don't really agree with this. I believe that we should limit the options the user has in this case. Otherwise, suppose a user creates a tag `Cs2103` and starts assigning things to it. This tag will be permanently stuck at `Cs2103` and unless we give them a new command to change the specification of the tag name to either `CS2103` or `cs2103`. 

Not to say that forcing upper-case is definitely a better solution than what you suggested, but I do feel that enforcing capitalization is a more agreeable policy as opposed to someone not realizing that they can't change the capitalization of their tags after adding hundreds of contacts under the tag.

On further further deliberation, I realize there is still a necessity to standardize the capitalization of tags. When two separate Persons are added with tags `cs2103` and `CS2103`, should a lookup of the tag produce both? Otherwise, if yes then why not standardise how the tags themselves look. If no, then I personally feel that it kind of beats the point of implementing search by tags to begin with.

I think `Updates all appointments with the given {@code Patient target} with the given {@code editedPatient}` would be better as it implies that multiple appointments will be updated.

I think this is correct.
I believe that the check is if `target `and `editedAppointment `does not overlap, check to ensure that the `editedAppointment `does not overlap with any other appointments. 

If the `target `and `editedAppointment `do overlap, you are sure that there will be no problem adding the `editedAppointment` as it can safely replace the `target`.

Actually for simplicity, we can also consider this: call `remove` on target, then call `add` on `editedAppointment`. If it throws `OverlappingAppointmentException`, then we `add` back `target`

I agree with Wanlin actually, I think that it should be `ParseException` instead. Although `IllegalValueException` is the parent class, we expect `parseIndex` to only throw `ParseException` and if it throws anything else we know that this is unexpected behaviour that we should fix.

I think what Shawn said makes sense. It might be better to stick to terms that are already established eg `InternshipStatus`. If I am not wrong does the `status` class exist only for `Internship`? If that is the case, maybe you can consider shifting `date` to the `Internship` object instead and as such, there won't be any ambiguity in the naming.

hmmm, I am not very sure if it should be an exception instead. I was following the assert from oracle java. 
```
The absence of a default case typically indicates that a programmer believes that one of the cases
will always be executed. The assumption that a particular variable will have one of a small number
of values is an invariant that should be checked with an assertion.

While trying to reformat, I realized that We would need to know the Type of command in order to get its `MESSAGE_USAGE`. If we were to shift it to `GeneralParserUtil`, we would need to determine the Type of command and pass it as a a parameter into the static method in `GeneralParserUtil`. However, this determining of the type of command is already present in the `parse` command, as such we might be writing two `switch cases`. However, if we would want to write only one `switch cases`, we might have to change how the code would like like.

Also from the way we coded previously, the switch case in the `parse` method would never go to the default case, we can do an assert false there? (Since the checking is already done in the `checkCommandDetailsIsNotBlank`)

However, a method that is possible is that we will have to shift that `checkCommandDetailsIsNotBlank` into each of the cases in the switch method as well as introducing an extra parameter.

Sorry, I don't quite understand what do you mean about profile item having a general error message :O

**Issue**

I reaslied this as well. For commands that are without the letter specifier, like 
`view me 1`
`delete me 1`
It seems to have this special other error message generator. 

And as a result, since find is somewhat the same, I try to extract this duplicated method from view and delete as well. 

**In comparison to other classes**

I realised for the earlier commands like Add, the message is encapsulated inside each of the individual type of add commands instead, because they made used of tokenizer as its checker

While for the later commands like view and delete me, since we dont need to use the tokenizer, it seems like we generated another method for checking instead

> I agree that overwriting Javadocs now may be redundant, especially because our code can change over time up until the final version. At the same time, I also agree that we may miss them in the future, and doing a one-time run-through of all our code at the end may be very tedious and error-prone. As such, how about we do something like: every time we create new bits of code that require Javadocs, or we modify code that already has Javadocs attached to them, we place a standardized comment, such as `TODO: Javadocs` above the code we need to write/edit Javadocs for? That way we get the syntax highlighting that IntelliJ provides for the `TODO` keyword, and we can also search for this standardised comment throughout the code base to hone in on where we'll eventually need to write/edit Javadocs when the time comes. Any thoughts on this?

I think this is a great idea what do the rest think?

With this implementation of the parsing of user input, what happens if the user inputs something like:
`addexp ... f/for now no` OR  `addexp ... f/think no`. 

Although in an actual use scenario this is very unlikely to, or will never happen, but would the parser still allow the creation of the expense object in this scenario?

I think this implementation still allows for `intYear` to be negative? For example `range.isValidIntValue(-999)` will still return true.

Sounds good! I was thinking of doing so after the other parsers are done since for example the `EditParser` for the `InternshipCommand` may want to abstract 3 items  (comindex, index ,prefixes)? So it depends on implementation of the parsers first then after which we deal with abstraction for common vars.

Hmm. The dilemma now is that this is just a proof of concept and we may be abstracting common logic down the line and scrapping all these, so overwriting Javadocs now may redundant. The danger is that if the code is kept and the comments are missed in the future. What is the team's opinion on this? @ZoroarkDarkrai @keanecjy @seanjyjy @shawn-nyk

> Yup I think that there isn't a need to concern about javadocs / comments as of now as they can be easily fixed at any point in time. @orzymandias I stopped editing the List portions as I noticed that there were too much code duplication with your pr. Do we plan to either extend an `Item` class or use generics for our list?

I agree. I think there is unnecessary duplication for collections, generics is a good idea for collections but one issue is with throwing custom exceptions for different types of items within the generic list. Should we just have DuplicateItemException then something like `throw new DuplicateItemException(T.getDuplicateExceptionMsg())`?

I figured since we all are classifying our classes as `Item`, we can have an `Item` interface to contain all the methods similar methods like `isSameItem` and likewise do `throw new DuplicateItemException(item.getItemName())`?

> Is this implementation temporary in order to allow ab3 to function properly?

For `AddCommandParserWrapper` each item has its own set of parsing rules which may require their own individual parsers so the `AddCommandParserWrapper`  is only responsible for funneling the appropriate item prefix to its add parser. The thing about delete command parser is that there is lesser parsing involved except for extracting out the index to be deleted. With the exception of internship which has an additional index required, all the other commands just need the index extracted to be passed to their delete commands. So I am not sure there is a need a wrapper in that case. 

As for consistency I think once AddCommandParser can be safely removed, we can rename `AddCommandParserWrapper` to `AddCommandParser`.

When I thought on how to handle the program's logic, I found out that putting lessons and tasks in Module will make it way harder to find/delete tasks & lessons. Instead, I think that we just keep lessons and tasks in separate lists and everytime we need to find lessons or tasks of a module, we can just do a O(n) search.

Not really relevant to this PR, but I think the parameter and example for editing a tag is missing the updated tag name. Example should be something like `tag edit 1 t/furniture`. Feel free to merge this PR if you want to resolve this in another PR.

sessionIndex is the previous index (index of session to change)

The issue is with RescheduleCommand only having the [INDEX] which takes care of the problem when [INDEX] > total schedules, but in Parser, I'm not able to retrieve the filteredSessionList as it requires Model to retrieve it, so FitEgo can't detect the issue when input session is higher than total sessions.
> 
>     3. Testing for this Reschedule is not fully up yet because there isn't a ScheduleCommandTestUtil class, not sure if this is required because now it's a bit tricky in a sense that Schedule contains Client and Session while RescheduleDescriptor contains clientIndex and sessionIndex of Index class. If RescheduleDescriptor were to contain Client and Session, it should be easier but in RescheduleCommandParser, similar to issue 2 above, I'm not able to retrieve the filteredSessionList as it requires Model to retrieve it.

try to detect the issue in command.execute() instead of parser?

Code might be easier to understand if `parseSortOrder()` only returns the argument which the user entered in the command. Then under the variable declaration for `isAscending()`, do an `equal()` check to see whether the argument the user provided is equal to `ASCENDING_ORDER`.

This is so that the nature of the `parseSortOrder()` method is also consistent with that of the `parseSortType()` method.

Noticed that you have declared various form of `SortCommands` as private static final variables in `SortCommandTest.java`, and they are repeated here.

I feel that it is ok to have this method as well as the hasDescription() method in the Project class, as a Project should be aware of the contents of its own fields and I can directly ask a Project whether it possesses these fields.

However, what you said sounds fine to me too. What do the others think?

That's going to be more readable in my opinion. 
Right now the tag command is like this. You cannot distinguish tag name and file address easily.

In my experience with CommandHistory's previousCommand(), be wary of the corner case if suppose:

as discussed with @halcon-blanco , we feel that having a wrapper class that holds instantiation of both DeliveryModel and InventoryModel is better than having to use instanceof to check and having to overload the Command#execute method due to huge amount of repetition of code

Following the wrapper class idea adheres to SLAP principle more than the latter solution

I would think that we should disable `cancel` if the date of the respective appointment to be cancelled is alright passed since there is no point to cancel an appointment which is already in the past. 
However, I think it would be different for `done` since there may be cases that the admin forgets to mark done and just lets it expire. `done` allows for the correction.

From commit 9b2ccce:

In process of Unittesting, dificulty was encountered from utilising
testing utilities of original code base.

Specifically the assertCommandSuccess testutil method, relies on the .equals
of model manager, and model manager equality has null values initialised for AB3
and Inventoryinator versions, which if implemented to check, cause testcase
failures in stubs.

Recommended to perform refactor to code base and remove ab3 artifacts, for more effective
testing.

Will open new issue based on this finding.

I assume we're using Person's Name and Phone classes for now since they help guarantee certain text properties.

Perhaps we could name this `InternshipStatus` or something along those lines instead? Do let me know if I'm mistaken, but it seems that we have a Job class that has the variables - jobTitle, companyName and industry. So this status object should be reflective of an Internship status rather than a Job status? Shall we ensure that "Job" and "Internship" are not interchangeable terms throughout our code base? Another issue that might still arise even after changing the name to `InternshipStatus` is that we will then have a `Status` and `InternshipStatus` class, and it may not be obvious what the difference is between the 2 in terms of their names? Would it be possible/better to make this a private enum within the Status class?

As we'll also need to add Jobs in a company object, this `Job` object seems to differ implementation-wise from the `Job` object that we may use for company objects, though they should probably be the same? For example, in a `Company` object, during its creation via a user command, the user can input multiple industries and jobs that a company has. This creates the `Company` object, along with its multiple jobs and industries. So in those `Job` objects in the `Company` object, will each of them have multiple industries tagged to them instead of just one industry as in this `Job` object? Also, since a `Company` stores `Job` objects, would this create a cyclical dependency if we change the `Name companyName` part to `Company company` in the future (I assume we will)? At this juncture, it seems that if `Job` is going to store Company and Industry, perhaps we may not even need `Job` objects? Perhaps we could simply use String (or Name) for jobs? This may also help to synchronize with how jobs will have to be represented in a `Company` object.

Ah I see, thanks for the clarification! I think the `Status` and `ApplicationStatus` names suggested work, but perhaps sticking to `InternshipStatus` might still be better so we don't introduce more terms for the same object (for e.g. application and internship both refer to internship applications)? So maybe swapping the current `Status` and `InternshipStatus` names will do? May have to consult the rest haha, just some suggestions!

I see we've changed the tab name from plural to singular. I was wondering if it would be odd since the user would be looking at a tab labelled "Company" but in it can be multiple companies?

This works if all our commands require a switch? At the moment that seems to be the case apart from the help and exit commands if I'm not mistaken. Also, I suppose it depends on how we want our app to behave exactly - do we want it to switch every time a command is executed even if the user is already on the right page, or do we want to switch only if the user is on the wrong page? I suppose this may not be detectable visually unless the switching of tabs introduces its own behavior (for example if switching causes the list of cards to jump to the top of the list, and not switching allows the user to stay at wherever they've scrolled to in the list, then executing a command that always switches vs. one that only switches when necessary will provide different user experiences).

Now that the return statements have been shifted into the if-else block, I think there may not be a need to declare a `String resultMessage` variable anymore on line 40?

As all our list commands are going to have similar success messages, perhaps we could do what we did with the rest of the commands which would be to add something like this after line 25: `String listSuccessMessage = String.format(MESSAGE_LISTED_ITEMS, APPLICATION_NAME);` where `MESSAGE_LISTED_ITEMS` resides in Messages.java and goes something like: `"Listed all %1$s items";`?

True, this class is indeed very similar to the Name class. However, in order to do the following:
> pass in the messageConstraints to signify a different error message if need to

perhaps we can modify the Name class to, say, take in an extra argument in its constructor for the `messageConstraints` variable, and then the passing in of this variable could be done by the Industry class that extends the Name class and simply passes its own messageConstraints through the parent (i.e. Name's) constructor via super(). As such, we'll reduce code duplication but still maintain the existence of the Industry class. I feel that it may be necessary to have such unique classes because variables such as `private final Set<Industry> industries = new HashSet<>();` would look rather odd as `private final Set<Name> industries = new HashSet<>();`. And ultimately, in order to "pass in the messageConstraints to signify a different error message if need to", I believe we'll still need to have some sort of *Name as parent class for subclasses such as Industry, Descriptor, Requirement, etc.* arrangement, since Industry is not the only class affected by this / has this characteristic.

All that said, modifying Name and abstracting all the common fields to subclass from it at this juncture would be inappropriate in the context of this PR. Would it be okay if we let this portion through first and do the necessary abstraction / refactoring after all 4 items (inclusive of this Company item) are present in our codebase, as discussed in our Tele group?

I can't shift it straight into the current if-else block due to the nature of the condition checking. If we want to make it all part of one block, here's an option:
```
if (model.getTabName() != TabName.APPLICATION) {
    model.setTabName(TabName.APPLICATION);
    shouldSwitchTab = true;
    model.setViewIndex(targetIndex);
} else if (model.getViewIndex().equals(targetIndex)) {
    resultMessage = messageAlreadyViewing;
    shouldSwitchDisplay = false;
} else {
    model.setViewIndex(targetIndex);
}
```
But this means `model.setViewIndex(targetIndex)` appears twice.

Another option is to simply remove the if condition and do:
```
if (model.getTabName() != TabName.APPLICATION) {
    model.setTabName(TabName.APPLICATION);
    shouldSwitchTab = true;
    model.setViewIndex(targetIndex);
} else if (model.getViewIndex().equals(targetIndex)) {
    resultMessage = messageAlreadyViewing;
    shouldSwitchDisplay = false;
}

model.setViewIndex(targetIndex);
```
But this means that even when the model's view index is already the index that the user inputs, we still set it anyway (unnecessary call to setViewIndex). It won't affect the program though.

Between the current code and these 2 options, which do yall think is better? Or are there other alternatives yall may have?

Hi Keane! Unfortunately that would not be possible. Variables can't be declared in an if-else block and then used outside of it due to variable scope. Even doing something as simple as:
```
if (true) {
    boolean shouldSwitchTab = false;
} else {
    boolean shouldSwitchTab = false;
}
shouldSwitchTab = true; // line X
```
Will lead to an error on line X whereby it doesn't detect that shouldSwitchTab has been initialized.

To justify having these boolean vars initialized and declared where they are, we can take it that by default, we assume the user in on the appropriate tab (`shouldSwitchTab = false`) and not viewing the current item (`shouldSwitchDisplay = true`) which is why they would want to execute the view command in the first place. However, they may happen to be on the wrong tab (first if statement checks for that), or they may happen to be on the right tab and already viewing the item (the following else-if statement checks for that). That is how I would intend the code to be read!

Ah good question! I raised this in our Tele group last night, but basically how the view index works is that it takes the index from the tab that is currently in view. So for example, if a user is on say the Application tab and he is viewing the 3rd Application, if he executes `view com 3`, if we do not check for the tab first, then the program will simply think we're already viewing the 3rd item so it doesn't need to do anything, which is wrong of course. That said, now that you've raised this point, I believe I may be able to abstract away the first if statement, but I'll definitely need that condition check in the else-if statement that checks for if the user is on the same tab and currently viewing the indexed item. So I can minimize the tab checking but we need that one minimally.

Oh if that's the case, sure I don't mind changing it! But then again I'm not sure if our evaluators have the same understanding though? For example when we eventually evaluate our peers' work, I would probably follow the coding standard to cross-check my evaluation and if I spotted this violation in their work, I would probably just mark it as a violation since it is stated in black and white and not have to think too much. If you have the source, could you point me to where Prof Damith mentioned that we could do otherwise? Would be much appreciated!

> Hmm. The dilemma now is that this is just a proof of concept and we may be abstracting common logic down the line and scrapping all these, so overwriting Javadocs now may redundant. The danger is that if the code is kept and the comments are missed in the future. What is the team's opinion on this? @ZoroarkDarkrai @keanecjy @seanjyjy @shawn-nyk

I agree that overwriting Javadocs now may be redundant, especially because our code can change over time up until the final version. At the same time, I also agree that we may miss them in the future, and doing a one-time run-through of all our code at the end may be very tedious and error-prone. As such, how about we do something like: every time we create new bits of code that require Javadocs, or we modify code that already has Javadocs attached to them, we place a standardized comment, such as `TODO: Javadocs` above the code we need to write/edit Javadocs for? That way we get the syntax highlighting that IntelliJ provides for the `TODO` keyword, and we can also search for this standardised comment throughout the code base to hone in on where we'll eventually need to write/edit Javadocs when the time comes. Any thoughts on this?

Thanks Keane! And oops my bad, made some last minute changes and pushed after I first made the PR (introduced some checkstyle errors in the process). I've made a few other further changes to remove some hard-coded messages and make our add commands' success messages similar in execution to that of delete commands (calling upon the Messages class).

To explain this code:

Line 43 executes a function that creates delete int commands and executes them, causing the model's internal tab name to be set to company. Thus, before that line is executed, we need to save the current actual tab the user is on, which is done in line 40. Since we are checking against this saved tab instead of the model's current tab (would become company because of line 43), we cannot use the `CommandUtil.getCommandResult()` method.

Time is compulsory for LocalDateTime in java.time so unless a dummy time is added in, LocalDateTime cannot be used.
I think it would be cumbersome to try to differentiate between the dummy time and the actual time if any. I think this mainly has to do with the backend part.
Then since the time and date is separated, it would easier to parse them separately.

After checking the hierarchy of java.time, I realised the only common class ancestor of Date, Time and DateTime is java.lang.Object but they do implement similar interfaces. So I decided to make Date, Time and DateTime to implement a common Instance interface instead of a common class. And also if Date and Time inherit from the same class, it would imply that Date and Time is comparable.

I mean the toString, equality, hashcode tests. Could use VALID_WAGE, VALID_PERIOD, etc? If it's a better practice to use "Sunday", "React Native", etc. it's fine then.

Sure then! I just thought maybe using constants could make it easier to see, that creating an object with the same input will result to an equal one. Like 2 objects created with VALID_PERSON_ALICE are equals but not with one created with VALID_PERSON_BOB.
LGTM!

Yes. I expect it to have more errors. 
Because, the actual data file is saved as caps Client instead of client.

I can only help u find these (those files in /JsonAddressBookStorageTest & /JsonSeralizedAddressBookTest) files, that you might be likely to change them from caps C to small C. Maybe there are others that are not flagged out

It's for testing purposes and to also remind programmers under what conditions this call should be made only. I wrote this with the intention that the programmer should only call setToAccommodationList() if the directory is a Travelplan. I was thinking about try catch, but it's not a scenario the user will face, since this should be configured by programmers (and should not happen because of user input/calls). It's also okay to write try catch, but there should not be any exception in the first place unless there is a bug in the program.

yeah so i think the `default` branch in here should throw something like an `IllegalArgumentException` (for us to see, since this branch should never be reached), and the one in `SortEventCommandParser.parse` should throw a `ParseException` (for the user to see, if they input an invalid number).

hmm, interestingly this is also something that i had issues with. i avoided using `AddressBookParser.COMMAND_TYPE` as i did not want to create further cyclic dependencies (`AddContactCommandParser` -> `AddContactCommand` -> `AddressBookParser` -> `AddContactCommandParser`).

a plausible solution would to be to create an enumeration to only store command words/types and for all command classes to reference that instead, so the test cases can remain untouched.

the implementation would be to create two enumerations - `CommandWord` and `CommandType` - and have `AddressBookParser` and the Command classes refer to the enumeration instead. this accomplishes two things:

1. resolves the aforementioned cyclic dependencies.
1. test cases can remain as is, since they currently refer to each individual Command class' word/type.

i think there is merit in having the test cases remain in their current classes as they are intended to test certain classes.

We have elected to update the UG for two reasons:

1. Consistency - some of the event methods end with an s while others do not. While this was intended to represent the plurality of some of the returns, this can be confusing for users unfamiliar with Athena. Additionally, to standardise methods between contacts and events, we should use the similarly worded commands for both. Since `list` is already implemented as a contact feature, we'll stick to `listEvent`.

2. Convenience - the documentation of `listEvent` in the UG is incorrect to begin with. Instead of having to correct both the method and the UG (to `listEvents`), we instead change only the UG.

I will update the UG by tomorrow to fix these inconsistencies.

i see your point, but i think the best solution is just to include a way for them to edit their tags after they've been created. as a user, i would not like having to be forced into using a certain case (be it upper or lower), as different cases can add nuance to the tags.

The method was added for the following reasons:
1. The Person and Visit classes both have these two methods in Model - getFiltered[x]List() and updateFiltered[x]List() where x is either of those classes. As the InfoHandler class requires the getFilteredLocationList(), I felt it was apt that updateFilteredLocationList() was added as well.
2. Also, the addLocation method in the ModelManager requires the updateFilteredLocationList() as well.

## Issues
### Format
When creating an issue, try to specify the part of the project the issue is meant to be working on by using square brackets in the title. If the issue does not specify anything, it is assumed to be implementation-based, i.e., related to modifying AB3/VirusTracker code. 

Example: `[DG] Add UC01 and UC02` indicates that this issue works on adding user cases 01 and 02 to the developer guide.

### Labeling

## Pull Requests

General note: PRs can only be merged only when two or more other people have reviewed and approved of the merge.

### Format for PR 
When creating the PR, please state which issues the PR closes on the last line of the description.

**Commit message:** `keyword #xx, keyword #yy, keyword #zz` for multiple issues
* `keyword` refers to any one of the following three words, `close`, `fix`, `resolve`.
   * Using these keywords will cause the issue to be automatically closed once the PR is merged successfully.
   * _Note: Other tenses for the above words could be used as well, such as `closes` or `closed`, but let us standardise using the 
     imperative form of the words above._
* `#xx` references the issue number, where xx is the number. For example, xx = 10 will reference issue number 10.

 Example: xx = 30
```
...PR description here

Close #xx
``` 
The above will close issue 30 upon the successful merging of the PR. 
_The actual form of #xx is not used in this comment as it would reference actual issues. Please refer to the PRs page for more examples._

Yes actually I copied most of it from the find-i command, and I was also confused as to what was being said here.

issue with this is that it becomes hard to make a canRedo() method without adding another pointer, which makes things messy. I think our array limit will never be set beyond a few 1000 so it's not an issue (and if it is ever changed, the code can be refactored then)

@Wincenttjoi I've made the changes you requested, plus changed the whole structure of the DeliveryList GUI to match that of the ItemList. (Tonnes of headache cuz debugging GUI is super hard). 

I also wrote the basic code in MainWindow.java for initialising the values into the DeliveryList on starting the app, with currently an empty ObservableList<Delivery> being initialised temporarily. The Delivery class I wrote is also currently just a stub with no functionality.

@Wincenttjoi I'm having some issues with the test cases (they work individually but don't work when the whole test suite is run. I've been googling but still am not sure where the issue is), don't think they'll be done any time soon. 

Maybe PR first so that the rest of development can work on top of it (for instance the new delivery commands will need to take this into consideration now)

Perhaps you could test for multiple predicates too. 

One suggestion would be to create your school/year predicate too and then create a `FindStudentDescriptor` from it, then have a method in `testutils.StudentUtils` that converts it into "n/... s/... y/..." form, similar to how it is done in `parseCommand_edit()`. The outcome would be:
`FindCommand.COMMAND_WORD + " " + StudentUtils.getFindCommandDetails()`

Additionally, if you are using prefixes, you might want to refer to them by how they are defined in `CliSyntax` instead of magic literals.

`Year` is actually a String now that accepts alphanumeric characters. Hence I think we should relax the requirements to be one where it returns true if `student.getYear().year` contains the keyword (e.g. `year` could be a String and it is matched using `StringUtils::containsWordIgnoreCase`). 
That way, if you search "4" you could get those who put "Sec 4", "sec 4" or "Secondary 4" if the user is inconsistent.

It also means you will be less likely to land an `IllegalArgumentException` if the user parses an invalid string since right now `FindCommandParser` currently has to call `Year#new` to construct this.

Would it be more helpful if we made it look only for words that contain all the keywords (even incomplete ones)? (i.e. `AND` search)

`return keywords.stream().map(String::toLowerCase).allMatch(year::contains);`

I'm not sure if we can follow the original client find command, because for that command, we don't have to parse the different prefixes. Whereas for findsvc, we need to parse for both title and service code and ensure that only one of them is chosen. Can see @yanlynnnnn 's findexp command to see how she did hers.

Yup he did, but I needed to extend it with more methods. I need a contains method with parameter ServiceCode to check if the service code belongs to an existing service. I can't just insert that as a generic method to Unique List, so I created UniqueServiceList to extend UniqueList<Service>.

I think this is a good topic for discussion. Currently, AB3 only uses the weaker notion of equality, `isSameItem` for the edit command. The add command on the other hand checks based on the `equals` method. Do we want to change it such that it uses the same notion of equality as well?

Since many of our commands require the `parseIndex` to throw a specific message, we could pass in the specific error message in the `parseIndex` function.

Yes haha, I had a good laugh earlier when I represented wage as a Phone object. Reason I did so was to use AB3's current implementation of the `Name` object (which is basically a class with a string containing only AlphaNumeric characters) and `Phone` object (which is essentially a class with a string containing only Numeric characters). I think that we can rename it in the near future and make use of them in all our classes. What do you think?

Yup, I think its best if we could ensure that the "Job" and "Internship" names are not used loosely throughout the code base. I don't particularly like the idea of a nested class, since I do intend to use the enum outside of this Status class (for parsing and input). Also, would it better to rename the `Status` class as `ApplicationStatus` and the enum to be called `Status` instead?

Thanks for the input. I created a Status class to abstract out the application status and date details from the internship. But perhaps now that I think about it simply renaming the fields to `InternshipStatus` and `StatusDate` would do. Let me know if this arrangement is fine.

deepDelete uses the `isSameItem` method defined in the abstract Item class, which compares 2 items based on the weaker notion of equality, which I defined it to be comparing only the internship item. Hence why I created the deepDelete method! I will change the method name to `deleteSameItem`, hopefully its clearer that way.

Not sure what is the group's consensus on this, so I took the easier path first which is to switch tabs after successful command. Could it be because the command is executed unsuccessfully? Because this should be correct since I took this from @seanjyjy switch tab command.

Yup I think that there isn't a need to concern about javadocs / comments as of now as they can be easily fixed at any point in time. @orzymandias I stopped editing the List portions as I noticed that there were too much code duplication with your pr. Do we plan to either extend an `Item` class or use generics for our list?

> ecessary duplication for collections, generics is a good idea for collections but one issue is with throwing custom exceptions for different types of items within the generic list. Should we just have DuplicateItemException then something like `throw new DuplicateItemException(T.getDuplicateExceptionMsg())`?

I don't think this works because we are not able to access methods in java generics. I figured since we all are classifying our classes as `Item`, we can have an `Item` interface to contain all the methods similar methods like `isSameItem` and likewise do `throw new DuplicateItemException(item.getItemName())`?

Not too sure what's the correct which is the correct way, but I just thought that doing it this way by writing 2 strings that are different objects would be better since we will be comparing periods with different strings in the actual implementation too

Oh what I meant was create sample data for the storage tests and not to test the application classes themselves. So the rest of the files can stay except for `ApplicationItemTest`, `StatusTest` and `StatusDateTest`. Hope this clarifies!

Yes, I think it is sufficient to check the name for duplicate tasks. However, could you clarify the implementation of the above hasTask method? The javadocs says that it will check if there is an existing task with the same name, date, and type in the todo list. In that case shouldn't checking for same name be enough?

yes, it is designed to modify its input arguments. this wouldn't be necessary if java had some semblance of decent features after 14 versions, like pattern matching;

this is how i use bisect in a proper language:
```cpp
std::string_view x;
std::string_view xs;

std::tie(x, xs) = util::bisect(input, ' ');
if(x.empty()) return { };

if(x[0] == '@')
{
	parse_tags(msg, x);
	std::tie(x, xs) = util::bisect(xs, ' ');
}

if(x[0] == ':')
{
	parse_prefix(msg, x);
	std::tie(x, xs) = util::bisect(xs, ' ');
}
```

unfortunately this can't be done in java (there's no `std::tie` equivalent, nor can there ever be). rather than introduce loads of syntactic noise by needing to (a) declare a pair to store the bisectionr result; (b) declare or assign a variable for the first part; (c) declare or assign a variable for the second part, it is more convenient this way.

besides, `bisect()` clearly documents its mutating behaviour.

for this kind of boolean parameter, i suggest doing something like this:
```suggestion
        return new CommandResult(SHOWING_HELP_MESSAGE, /* showHelp: */ true, /* exit: */ false);
```
so that it's easier to see what the `true` and `false` mean without going into the definition of the class/function.

less typing. as you know typing places strain on your wrist, which is bad for health <-> `var` is good for health

ok but most of the time, `var` is used either (a) when the type is obvious, like this:
```java
var foo = new SomeOverlyLongClassName();
// versus:
SomeOverlyLongClassName foo = new SomeOverlyLongClassName();
```

and (b) when the type is not important, like in this case. explicitly writing `Map.Entry<Optional<ExpiryDate>, Quantity>` is tedious and doesn't contribute anything to the clarity of the code.

May you revert this line first? Because some of other code that I wrote is dependent on the filtered project list, and deleting this line may cause some bugs at this stage. I will probably deal with the problem later and delete this line together.

Hmm, as @YangYue128-helen mentioned, perhaps it'll be ok to leave out this check as we are able to support view commands without a `DATE ` predicate as well? 

Based on line 53 of `ViewCommand.java`, the current system seems to support the display of all future appointments if the predicate input is null (in the case that a date is not entered by the user) so I think you've got it covered @ZhangWanlin98 👍🏻

Oh wait after reviewing `NuudleParser` as mentioned by @JinHao-L , I think the check done here is actually valid as the ViewCommandParser is only instantiated if extra input by the user following the `view` command is detected. Hence, it actually indicates an invalid command format if `PREFIX_DATE `is empty as it would mean that something else is written.

Hmm I added the square brackets following the tutorial given in our textbook. I believe they added it in as entering an empty remark serves to remove an existing remark assigned to the same patient. Currently, nurses can use the remark command to both create new and modify existing remarks.

Oh I've done some tracing and found that `IllegalValueException` is normally used when your method is passed a wrong input.  

In the case of `parseIndex`, a `ParseException` is thrown to represent the errors encountered when the input index isn't a valid number (i.e >0) or is a letter. 

However, since `ParseException` extends `IllegalValueException`, using `IllegalValueException` in this catch block will allow us to catch various kinds of `ParseException` should we decide to extend the functionality of our code in the future since it's the parent class.

Personally, I think it'll be a good addition to have this enhancement for our future iterations as it may seem like a bug if we are able to `cancel` an appointment that happened in the past. However, I realized that it shouldn't be the case for `done` since we will only mark an appointment as completed after it has occurred. Thanks for pointing it out Jin Hao :)

Yea good point! I'm able to limit the number of characters a user can add for a remark. However, I think the challenge with doing this may be the need to display the number of characters remaining(while the user is typing?) as it'll be hard for the user to manually count the number of characters added.

Hey Jin Hao, thank you so much for pointing out the error!

I've been meaning to consult the team prior to seeing your comment. The links you provided were really helpful to the resolution of the test errors I encountered. Alternatively, I have updated the settings in my IntelliJ to resolve the issue. You can check out the following link for the alternative strategy I employed.

Thanks for pointing them out! I agree with Jeffrey on the third point as well, I think it would improve user experience if we let for instance a delete command with random string at the back to pass through rather than forcing the user to re-enter the command without the random string. 

As for the first point, may I clarify if you meant for e.g. add vs Add (or any other variations of add) in the case of command string to be insensitive?

Also, another bug I noticed was for delete, find and view, the ordering of arguments matter. In our user guide, it was mentioned that parameters can be in any order. However, without any delimiter in place, like t/TYPE, it will be hard for us to ascertain which word is for type and which word is for name of supplier/warehouses (in the case of find and view). I was thinking if we should specify that ordering does not matter for all commands except delete, find and view in our user guide to be clear. 

EDIT:
Just to add on, the current way of handling adding of suppliers and warehouses has a bug since type of determined by doing a substring of trimmed arguments. If users are allowed to reorder the arguments, the parser will detect this as an invalid command.

In addition for adding of supplier, it seems like email address has to be a compulsory field (invalid command is shown), but in the UG it is an optional field. Should we still keep email address field as an optional field?

For adding of warehouses, if remarks field (which is optional) is left out, a java.lang.reflect.InvocationTargetException will be thrown. I think we missed out these cases, but no worries, let's fix them in v1.3 iteration! :)

For the part about commands only keeping the results from the last occurrence of a specified descriptor, I think it was originally not so much a bug but rather an intended outcome, as there are explicit test cases in the original AB3 to show that multiple descriptors of the same prefix will be accepted without error but only the last will be used. We can do an alternative approach though I would not think its absolutely necessary.

As for the case sensitivity, I guess we can discuss both the case sensitivity of the command syntax (command word/prefixes) and the user-supplied command arguments. For the command word at least, the case should not matter and we can make it case-insensitive to improve user experience, though I would think it's not a pressing issue as we can do without too.

For the redundant strings at the back of commands and the explicit ordering of arguments, it currently applies for those commands that dont actually use prefixes. For those with prefixes, changing it to allow redundant arguments may be a bit cumbersome, since currently all the arguments at the back will just be allocated to the last prefix, and we would require additional command-specific parsing to split the last prefix from the redundant strings if they would otherwise be parsed as invalid format for the last prefix. For those that don't, we can either make it explicit that redundant strings are allowed in the user guide for these commands or just don't accept them. Similarly for the ordering, we can either make these commands accept prefixes as well since they are multi-argument like the rest of the commands so that they disregard order, or we can explicitly state their difference in the user guide.

Yes indeed, I will also change the project names to more appropriate "project-like" names too. But for now I just want to get the Name refactored and to fix all the errors. On the third PR when I refactor the Address and tags, I will change all the testcases and such.

For the Leader Object, you want to make it an instance of a Person? Such that it can contain email, address etc. I have included that in my implementation of Teammate. Lemme change that to Person then maybe your Leader can be an instance of Person too. This way you dun have to create email classes etc for the Leader

@halcon-blanco i'm fine with this, since we might need to change again in the future into 3 sections so no issue. For the colouring, is it easy to implement colouring to be conditional (red vs green if stock falls below 20%)? If its a huge task we can create a separate task.

Low priority: I didn't do the GUI for help toolbar on top to open up the 2 different help windows since the app is meant for CLI primarily. But feel free to connect them if you want :)

If you throw `ParseException` in `ExportCommandParser`, then perhaps can add `parse_invalidArgs` test case?

Initially it was because `ClientUtil.java` needed to build the command given the client's details, I changed the implementation of `getClientDetails` to explicitly use `getCountryCode()` so this function isn't currently in use now. I thought it would make sense to have `countryCode` since that is the value passed into the object like the other fields.

Currently have "([A-z ]+) ((\d+)?([ \w\/]+)?)" as the regex which tries to separate `commandWord` from `arguments` through detecting either a number or a prefix. Requires " " to be padded to the end but this fails for "client find KEYWORD".

I initially named it as `content` because I thought it would reduce confusion from having too many "choice" names.
But `choice` works fine too.

Perhaps we can make use of the regex method used by the other classes in model? In this case the validation format would be "^(3[01]|[12][0-9]|0[1-9])/(1[0-2]|0[1-9])/[0-9]{4}$" for dd/mm/yyyy. I believe it would make our code seem more in line with the existing code from AB-3.

I believe a better comparison would be between Leave and Address or Tag! Leave should handled the same way as how an attribute of the person is handled instead of being handled the same way as the Person itself. But you are right, I can have the parsing method imported from dateUtil to achieve better abstraction.

Was thinking if this can be improved to maintain the same level of abstraction as before, by constructing the Leave object with ` public Leave(LocalDate from, LocalDate to) ` because in other cases for example, 
Add Person, the text input goes from `Logic` -->  `AddressBookParser` --> `AddCommandParser` and this is where the Name, Email, Address Objects are made, then these objects are passed into `AddCommand` and is then passed into Model to add the person. 
I think this change does not make a difference logic wise, but helps make the level of abstraction more standard. But up to you to take it up.

Would it be better to change this to use like the standard `requireNonNull(personToEdit)` as used in all other places?
And perhaps, you could import the whole CommentCommand?

Perhaps you could use the same `requireNonNull ` function like in other places
And is there a way to just import the `CommentPersonDescriptor ` instead of calling it by `CommentCommand.CommentPersonDescriptor `

Good thoughts, I believe handling upper/lower case conversion on our end would improve user experience instead of making it case-sensitive. Especially when they are not able to correct minor typo by retrieving last typed command using the up arrow key like we do in terminals. 

You're right, I just tried for add command and it process everything but only keeps the results from the last occurrence. This is a bug and should be resolved unless a command explicitly takes in 2 of the same prefix. Good catch Zhen Lin.

I would think that redundant arguments can be safely ignored if they do not interfere with the given command. We can set up a response that notify them of the `random string` while letting the command run through. This would be even more useful when we implement undo and redo commands.

Are we going to pass Logic object (only) in the UiManager for later iterations? 
So that UI is only directly associated with Logic object, and Logic object will decide which Logics (LogicMode, LogicPerson, LogicMeeting, or LogicDeliverable) to call. 

(If yes, can we add a TODO comment? e.g. `/**TODO: Pass only Logic object**/`

Yes, it was. Meeting B's From value is 'earlier' than A's. Since we are comparing the result of deleting a meeting from a model that is auto sorted with `getTypicalMeeting().get(INDEX_FIRST_PERSON.getZeroBased())`, the ArrayList retrieved from `getTypicalMeeting()` should be sorted too.

I think instead of writing in a point form, it could be written in full sentences. The language used here also feels informal and incomplete.
Some examples could be:
- More convenient than typical apps as lessons and assignments are managed in just one app so there is no need to switch between different ones.
- Easier to manage schedule than typical scheduling apps as assignments are automatically scheduled.

Since `Client` has a `hasClientNote` and `addClientNote` method, then you can bypass `Model` and just call `clientToAddNoteTo.adClientNote(clientNote)`?

actually all those variables aren't constants in the sense that for each instance of `Country` the `countryName`, etc can be different. Not sure if they are still considered constants?

Yea that was the intention to just init countryNotes from the start so there wouldn't be any bugs if someone using Country forgot to check if countryNotes exists. If there is a noticeable lag then probably can optimise in v1.3.

Save file can just store countries which actually have countryNotes in them, so no need to store all countries.

My idea is that whenever you are interacting with the existing `Country` instances (other than just getting country notes), you should only do it via `CountryManager`. I think this layer of abstraction is good especially for logging/debugging in the future since `Model` only needs to operate on `CountryManager` and I would be able to log all `Country` method calls.

For classes like the `CountryNoteParser` or `CountryFilterParser` they should not be holding references to the existing Country as they do not have a reference to `CountryManager`. Only `Model` has a reference to `CountryManager`. So when a `Command` executes on a `Model`, then they are able to check for duplicate notes, etc.

Also, `Country` has a `hasCountryNote` method, but I purposely made it `protected` so that only `CountryManager` can call that method. Other classes should only be able to call the constructor and `getCountryNote` method of `Country` only.

Current plan of action after discussion with @rtshkmr. This is a sample of how `notes` are going to be stored in JSON.
```
notes: [{
  contents: "some contents",
  tags: ["tag1", tag2"],
  client: "katya", // means this is client note
  country: null
}, {
  contents: "some contents2",
  tags: ["tag1", tag2"],
  client: null,
  country: "SG" // means this is country note
}]
```
Benefits of this implementation would be:
1. That there would only be 1 class that deals with json notes (irrespective of whether it is a client or a country note). 
2. Existing JSON client class does not need to be changed.

Possible issues:
1. Cannot uniquely identify `clients` by their name at the moment.

Would be good if you can include the `toString()` methods for the Answer and Question class, that way when it is implemented in the GUI it would be easier to render it seperately (since the current way to access the string form of the question and answer is through the Flashcard class). 

The current `toString()` method in FlashCard is still useful when interacting with the application through CLI 👍

Looks good! Just wondering whether it would be better if we made userAnswer an Answer type also, that way we can potentially do more things with it in the future. 

If userAnswer was an Answer type, we can just override `.equals()` as a way of comparison to check if userAnswer is indeed Answer.

The Timer class is only used to keep track of the active timers. Once the timer is stopped, the data is stored under a WorkDuration class (which has not reference to project), and put in a list inside the corresponding project.

I implemented it this way because I didn't want to store incomplete timers in a project, since it might cause problems if the timer wasn't stopped properly. Its also easier to check for active timers this way (see activeTimer in ModelManager)

And i think it would be easier to extend to having multiple concurrent timers if we decide to do that (then each timer needs to know which project its keeping track of)

Just storing the index won't work because the filtered list might change while the timer is running.

This is mostly what i was referring to when i said more/better tests are needed.

Basically, since I'm using LocalDateTime.now() to get the current time, 2 times will never be exactly the same (they will be some nanoseconds apart). For example in tests, even if I start 2 timers immediately after one another, they will have different values, so equals() will still say that they're different. Since the existing tests involve checking if 2 models are equal, this will break a bunch of existing tests.

I'm think of either (a) Overloading the timer functions so that I can start them at a fixed time (just for testing) or (b) Introduce a custom global clock for the application to run on. The global clock will be the same as system clock in production, but in testing it will have functions that allow us to manually control the time.

A user will never see this message (as of now) since we don't require users to manually input times. If we add commands that involve time inputs, then it might be better to not use ISO8601 format in the first place (its hard to read) and instead use some variation of the "yyyy MM dd hh:mm:ss" style.

This error only come up in logs when theres an error in loading saved data (e.g. the saved data is not in ISO format). For now I'll add an example of what the format looks like to the error message

I'm not sure if "set" is a prefix and need to add into here. Based on my understanding, we only need to add new prefix when we need to create a new field in a person model. Like if we create a field to record remarks, then we need to add "r/" as a prefix. But "set" does not function in this way. When user key in "set ...", then program will execute the "set", not to add the values behind to a field.

Do the others think it would be a problem that the time for deadline is not checked against created time? I know we are not saving the created time and this would mean we would need to make changes to the created date to include time but I feel like if we are checking the date, we should be checking the time as well. What do the others think?

The reason why I need to use HashMap is because not all projects have Deadlines, and I'm using Comparator.nullsLast to place all projects without deadlines at the end of the list after projects with deadlines, so I need to compare Deadlines (and not Projects). But after extracting the deadlines (or nulls), I will still need to compare the names alphabetically in case of same deadline or null deadline, which is why I need to return the name as well. Anyone can lmk if there is a cleaner way to do this!

> Just wondering if it would be better to keep to one deadline command to indicate both date and time (so we don't need dt/ and dd/) so if you want to indicate time, you can do something like dl/VALID_DATE, VALID_TIME and if you don't, you can just put dl/VALID_DATE. Perhaps we could discuss with the group. Other than that, LGTM:)

I think we should exclude the created date attribute when we are comparing two projects because it should not be an important attribute of the project? For example if I created this project yesterday and I forgot about it, and I make another entry today that has the exact same content, it should still be considered as a duplicate. What do the others think?

I think it's okay to init it for now. We could probably KIV this for further optimisations if it's ever a problem down the road?

The extension is specific to step 2 of the MSS ("TBM shows a list of clients that match user's query"), hence the extension should be named `2a` instead of `1a` isn't it?

`getCountryNote` was put to retrieve note associated to a country, to be used when the `TagNoteMap` shall be initialised from countries. This is related to the commented out initialisation method inside `TagNoteMap`, will be used in a later commit 👍

currently we have a 1-way dependency between notes and tags. This method existed for the case in the future when this dependency would have been removed. Since we're accepting this 1-way dependency for now, this should method should be removed but might be required in the future, hence I'll put the method here for reference: 

```
    /**
     * Links a new set of notes to a tag. This method exists in the case where we remove
     * the one-way dependency b/w tags and notes, then we'd need to use this. 
     *
     * @param newNotes The notes to associate with a particular tag.
     * @param tag      The tag to associate the notes with.
     */
    public void updateNotesForTag(Set<Note> newNotes, Tag tag) {
        requireAllNonNull(newNotes, tag);
        noteSet.addAll(newNotes);
        // update the tags set for each of the notes:
        for (Note newNote : newNotes) {
            if (noteToTagsMap.containsKey(newNote)) {
                noteToTagsMap.get(newNote).add(tag);
            } else { // new note:
                Set<Tag> tags = new HashSet<>();
                tags.add(tag);
                noteToTagsMap.put(newNote, tags);
            }
        }
        //update the notes set for the tag:
        Set<Note> currentNotes = tagToNotesMap.getOrDefault(tag, new HashSet<>());

Made a mistake by creating my `branch-README-...` from an existing branch: `DG update...` that's why there are two  commits for this PR when there should be 1. I'm putting this comment here as a reminder to myself for the future.

Agree with the code quality aspects pointed out by @qwoprocks  if we go by what the textbook outlines for static final variables.  

Premature optimisation might be unnecessary for now, but it's a minor aspect imo, @raysonkoh should make the design decision on this.

@AY2021S1-CS2103-T16-3/developers , @mkeoliya and I had a long discussion on how this value adds to our users. We weren't really able to find a concrete use case for this feature. Can anyone think of why this would be useful for our target users? We're leaning towards lowering the priority of (or even scrapping altogether) this User Story.

OTOH, we further refined our concept of the export feature, which we're documenting in #52 .

okay I have resolved this. The original AB3 uses this method as a weaker notion of equality between students. Because if we check all field && then it will become the equals method. But since we defined student to have this 4 compulsory fields, we can update it to check these fields. But I think we should not include the checks for admin fields when it comes in.

Hmmm what I thought was that input a date is more flexible and convenient. For instance user might want to look up a his/her schedule on a particular date, our app would translate that date internally to the day of week so that the user wouldnt need to check up the calendar. I was thinking of an extension along this lines too, where user could input a string indicating the day or week. What do you think?

Good point. This would make searching and filtering the `year` data easier. Based on this, I guess we may have to exhaust all possible levels of student that a tutor may have? My concern is that IP, IB, MOE mainstream tracks have different naming in their levels. Furthermore, there could be other level naming, for eg a tutor teaching music or arts may have different levels naming for their students.

Thanks Jeffery for the response!

* For the first point, I guess if we all agree on this, we can discuss in chat about the implementation detail (like whether to handle it in general parserUtil or somewhere else)
* For the second point, thanks and I'm guessing we also need to mention this in our user guide & Usage message if we treat this issue as a bug.
* For the third point, I think your suggestion is wonderful! We can also discuss later about the message format, etc.

what do you mean by the actual data file?
I've already made the changes to both of the mentioned files, but I still have 2 tests that failed, 1 of which is this screenshot, but I can't seem to find anywhere with Clients already

But I think for editclientdescriptor, the index is to filter our the client, but for my case, both client and session index are required to filter out the schedule just like how your deleteSchedule is like, it filters out the relevant schedule before it can be deleted

That's for future tests because it requires the find session function for it to work, that's why I commented it out for now

> Actually for simplicity, we can also consider this: call `remove` on target, then call `add` on `editedAppointment`. If it throws `OverlappingAppointmentException`, then we `add` back `target`

We should still throw a new exception when we `add` back the `target` right?

I think it should work since this is taken directly from our current UniqueModuleList class. In addition, field internalList is private means that it can only be accessed by the UniqueTodoList class and the code "((UniqueTodoList) other).internalList))" is inside the UniqueTodoList class. Hence, it is not a problem.

I am using the same implementation as our current ModuleList class (from AB-3). The reason is because module list is very similar to todo list. I think it is a good idea to maintain consistency and similarity for the implementation throughout the code? 

Or perhaps we should instead try to implement our own version of todo list that does not replicate the implementation of module list? i.e. todo list in cap5buddy package uses a different implementation by using arrayList instead.

TaskNotFoundException is an unchecked exception since it inherits from RunTimeException. I think the purpose of this exception is mainly for bug checking. In addition, the error message that will be shown to the user should be handled in the each of the Command class instead?

For instance, below code is taken from EditCommand class from the original AB-3 (this is absent from our current EditModuleCommand class though):

"if (index.getZeroBased() >= lastShownList.size()) {
    throw new CommandException(Messages.MESSAGE_INVALID_PERSON_DISPLAYED_INDEX);
}"

However, I think we can still add error message just to make it easier for the programmer to understand the error when debugging 😃

Yup. For the moment, I think we can implement 2 version of comparator classes e.g.

- DateComparatorAscend and DateComparatorDescend which inherits from DateComparator

and then we can either do the same for TaskComparatorByDate by creating 2 new classes or we can instead modify TaskComparatorByDate to take an argument which can be either DateComparatorAscend or DateComparatorDescend based on the user input,

e.g. TaskComparatorByDate(DateComparator comparatorDescend );

Yes, I think we should handle that in each of the Command class?

In addition, I just changed the isSameTask() method. Now 2 tasks are considered to be the same if only their name are the same since the other fields can be optional. I think it is sufficient to just check the name?

Maybe there could be a more intuitive command word such as olpd (overdue last paid date) or maybe just lpd or od or overduepayment.

If we are finding class time with respect to dayofweek, then would that mean that the user input of a specific date is redundant? If we just convert the specific user input date in dayofweek, we could just ask user to input 1,2,3,4,5,6,7 (Integer day of week).

Just a thought, shouldn't the validVisit be created based on the hard coded locationId INDEX_THIRD and personId INDEX_FOURTH? Right now valid visit still references the filtered list. If there's an error in the translation of ids between filtered list and the original lists, the test would still pass as both the AddVisitCommand and validVisit would have made the same error.

Yep something similar currently "sec 3" would match "sec 1-4", "p 3" and "s 3" but not "p3" or "s3" as it matches by whole words so "p3" is not "sec" or "3" hence it won't match. Same for "s3"!

Why will there be an error message after the tag is created (Line 326-328)? Maybe you can write it this way(?):
MSS
1. User requests to add a tag.
2. Projact adds a tag.
Use case ends.

Extensions
2a. The tag already exists.
2a1. Projact shows an error message.
Use case ends.

Is this clearer haha and also must we show in the use case that there are 2 ways to add a tag (like in user guide) or a general one (seen above) is ok?

1. "Address list" sounds a bit funny to me haha maybe contact list or phone book? Or keep it as address book? (but I'm not sure if this will fail the thingy when the script detects it).

Just tested with the current `master` branch code, 0 does not remove the role from the shift yet, but instead shift-edit removes all roles, then add the ones keyed in. Do we want to have the 0 = remove functionality, or just not allow 0 to be keyed in?

This is for us to get available rooms based on which Rooms we currently have that are booked. But the booking class only contains the room ids and not the Room object so the input may be a list of integer IDs instead? Depends on how we implement the rest so I think can leave it for now!

Yo! Regarding this:

> But when you use the old select command, ModelManager gets told to operate on the selected deck and stops operating on the stub deck
> Remember when I said the UI is tied to the stub decks UniqueEntryList field? This means that even though you are updating the selected decks list, nothing changes in the UI because nothing changes in the stub's UniqueEntryList

Could you please provide steps to reproduce the issue? What I did are as follow:

I resolved the concurrent modification issue caused by `replaceEntryList()` in `ModelManager.java` by changing the method body to:
```java
public void replaceEntryList() {
    observedDeck.setEntries(getCurrentDeck().getEntries());
}
```
I don't think removing all entries in `observedDeck.entries` is necessary since `observedDeck.setEntries(...)` will directly replace the old `entries` with new `entries`. Java garbage collector will handle the rest.

Next, I launched the program and issued the following command:
```
add w/test_word t/test_translate
```
and expected to see no update to the UI. However, I saw my new entry appear beneath all the stub entries.

I re-launched the program and tested these commands:
```
select 1
add w/test_word t/test_translate
```
and saw my new entry appear beneath all the stub entries too.

EDIT: fix stupid indent kena copied over from idea

**Steps to reproduce:**
Perform the following in order:
```
New deck
Add entry <word -> translation>
Close the program
Reopen
Select deck
Find entry
```

**Expected:**
- Finds the entry you searched for.

**Actual:**
- No entries found all the time.

**Possible reasons:**
- find command's filter by predicate might be causing the issue.

I will change it to something like this
 ```
   public String toString() {
        final StringBuilder builder = new StringBuilder();
        builder.append("Title: ")
                .append(getTitle() + "\n")
                .append(getDescriptionString())
                .append(getDateTimeString());
        return builder.toString();
    }
```
where getDescriptionString() is:
```
    private StringBuilder getDescriptionString() {
        StringBuilder emptyString = new StringBuilder("");
        return description.map(desc ->
                new StringBuilder("Description: ")
                        .append(desc.toString() + "\n")).orElse(emptyString);
    }
```
and getDateTimeString() is:
```
    private StringBuilder getDateTimeString() {
        StringBuilder emptyString = new StringBuilder("");
        return dateTime.map(time ->
                new StringBuilder("Time: ")
                        .append(time.toString() + "\n")).orElse(emptyString);
    }

Well like you said, it seems mildly infuriating to have to do `new Name(name)` every time you want to create a new instance of anything that uses `Name`. It's still useful to do regex validation though, unless we want to do it directly on the model itself.

Because in UniqueTagList, there is this test that checks whether the contains(Tag) method returns true even when the tag is edited. So to edit the tag, we will have to edit the person list (by adding one person in) that is attached to this tag. 

@Test
    public void contains_tagWithSameIdentityFieldsInList_returnsTrue() {
        uniqueTagList.add(CS2103T);
        Tag editedCS2103T = new TagBuilder(CS2103T).withPersons(VALID_PERSON_AMY)
                .build();
        assertTrue(uniqueTagList.contains(editedCS2103T));

As discussed with @mkeoliya, `DeallocateCommand` should use the `si/` prefix because in a future version, we will add support for allocating a room by student ID, which will then require a prefix. For commands that use only 1 argument, we will add support for usage of prefix to improve self-explanation.

Changes made:
* `DeallocateCommand` now takes in the student index using the `si/` prefix.

I think creating new commands will add unnecessary complexity to the system. It will take a lot of effort to set up even if we only provide for a small number of commands in the compound command. Even then, it will not provide much value since it will not take a lot of time to type a small number of commands, especially if aliasing is done well.

HAHA nah man its fine, but ya while i was doing jn i was actually wondering why the value of the `ModularCredits` was of type string 😅 however, if there's not much other things that require us to use it then i don't think it's necessary to refactor cause it might be troublesome, so it pretty much depends!

Some of your CI (Continuous Integration) checks have failed so you have to change it before we can merge the pull request. You can find out what is the issue by clicking on details > clicking the "..." button on the right > then lastly, clicking on full screen.

The errors will be the lines before the red alert message. It looks like there are some formatting issues with this pull request. For example:

-  ERROR:../src/main/java/seedu/address/model/person/Email.java:66: no newline at EOF.

This means that there is no empty line at the end of the Email.java file. Hence, you would have to rectify that to maintain formatting standards with the rest of the program.

### Select command has been fixed

**Fixing the UI**

I found out that during initialization, the wrong output of the method getFilteredEntryList() from ModelManager.java gets passed to the UI. This meant that the UI was watching the first decks UniqueEntryList. 

I changed it so that now the UI watches observedEntries from the PUBLIC field in AddressBook.java. 

_Hence, any changes to observedEntries from AddressBook.java will directly result in a change to the GUI._

**Select Command**

I edited the Select Command to now directly change the observedEntries, the low level details are documented in the code. 

Essentially, it creates a copy of the observedEntries, then deletes the original entries. It then fills observedEntries with entries of the selected command. The reason why we have to create a direct copy is to avoid the concurrent modification exception. Not the best performance O(n^2 * m) but performance can be optimized later.

**Issues**

The modification to AddressBook.observedEntries is done directly (because observedEntries is a public field), we should change this in the future. 

Now edit command has to be updated, please refer to the code I have written to get an idea on how to do it.

List command can be deleted as well

Clear command needs to be updated as well (should it clear decks or clear entries?)


**Homework for you guys:** 
- Fix the edit command such that it displays the edit command (for now, it only edits the deck's entrybut doesn't show it)
- Determine if list command needs to be deleted and delete/not delete it accordingly
- Do the same for clear command

Tested locally. All storage related tests passed. 

For TestDriver.java, if I run it multiple times, the data will be stored repeatedly into testingForExercise.json. Is that the desired outcome or should you first clear the file and then store the exercise book? (not sure about this)

Otherwise LGTM.

Those tests are for AB3. The tests throw a lot of incompatible errors because I modified the original classes (AddCommand, AddCommandParser etc.) instead of creating new ones.

> For the Leader Object, you want to make it an instance of a Person? Such that it can contain email, address etc. I have included that in my implementation of Teammate. Lemme change that to Person then maybe your Leader can be an instance of Person too. This way you dun have to create email classes etc for the Leader

Maybe we want to wait for Lucas to implement the association class and make Leader class a subclass of association?

The TestDriver is created to ensure that I can read and write from the data. 
 The reason for the repeats is because it reads all the items in the storage, can't realize that items with same name and date are the same (cuz i am using stubs) and just add items at the end of the list.
The TestDriver also includes reading from past records and add the same set of Exercise at the end.

Pushed a fix regarding the issue above. 

This implementation also allows the user to edit the default profile picture to something of their choice, by editing `data/stock_picture.png`. If the user wants to return to the default profile picture, they can just delete `data/stock_picture.png` and the app will automatically regenerate the file on the next run.

I'm not sure if this should be added into the User Guide, since it's a niche use case.

In the process of coding my own tests, I found that the test code heavily depends on variable file paths, and it would be hard to write test code for the sections with hardcoded paths.

As testability is a grading criterion (I think?), I am increasing the priority of this issue.

Okay with moving it to session and changing the keyword to sview. Not sure if there's a need to use p/ tags since there's only 2 variations in mind now. But if so, `sview p/week` and `sview p/all`? Think we can discuss it later

Change to a clearer def. Since TBM performs basic contact management/tracking, the use case should be able to handle the scenario when the user inadvertently tries to add a duplicate entry for someone he might already have an entry. (Could be due to previous professional deals, working relations... etc that he forgot.). Duplicate entries would cause the archives to get messy, and so I added the case where TBM prevents/User does not add the duplicate entry.

The new business deal might involve some party which the user has encountered before and thus might have an entry in TBM, but forgot. So I wrote the uc in a vague way to put in the duplicate entry uc. @raysonkoh

Can't pass CI due to checkstyle error in RemarkCommandTest.java.
Checkstyle document says to put "import org.junit.jupiter.api.Test" **after** the "import static seedu" statements, but upon doing that, it says that the "import org.junit.jupiter.api.Test" is **lexicographically before** the "import static seedu" statements, and should be put before them. I don't know how to solve this checkstyle conflict.

I'm not sure why during this particular test, the index to be deleted is ` INDEX_SECOND` while it should be `INDEX_FIRST`. This could be a testing issue instead of a bug in the source code, yet I can't find any problem when inspecting both the source code and the testing code. I will check through again and get back after!

I have made the changes discussed, do help to review! Regarding the first test case in `DeleteFlashcardCommandTest`, there seems to be a problem with it in the source code. If there are no problems with it when we manually test it in the UI, consider this issue non-existent and an error from my written tests.
